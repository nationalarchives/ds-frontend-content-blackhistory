          <td>This is the deposition of Anthony de Nicholao Rimero (a Venetian 
            sailor and occasional 'drinking pal' of Pietro Paulo Corso), 
            his Black diver Jacques Francis (here called 'James'), 
            and other named servants of Corso's. In it, Rimero denies that 
            Corso has suffered any loss as a result of the accusation made against 
            him. <br>
            <br>
            Rimero's deposition confirms the slave status of Jacques Francis. 
            He goes on to state that, as 'a morisco born where they are 
            not christened' and a slave, no weight should be given to anything 
            Francis says. Similarly, in Domenico Erizo's deposition (in 
            HCA 24/17), the validity of a statement made by a 'pagan infidel 
            black' is also questioned. <br>
            <br>
            We do not know if Jacques Francis had been baptised, although his 
            European name could suggest it. Nor do we know how far Rimero and 
            Erizo's objections were based on his colour, his non-Christian or 
            perhaps merely 'Christianised' state, his status as a slave, or a 
            combination of these factors. We do, however see all these forms of 
            prejudice being utilised to justify discrimination against and mistreatment 
            of Black people for centuries to come.<br>
