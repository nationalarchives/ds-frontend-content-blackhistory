                  and welfare of her own natural subjects, greatly distressed 
                  in these hard times of dearth, is highly discontented to understand 
                  the great number of Negroes and blackamoors which (as she is 
                  informed) are carried into this realm since the troubles between 
                  her highness and the King of Spain; who are fostered and powered 
                  here, to the great annoyance of her own liege people that which 
                  co[vet?] the relief which these people consume, as also for 
                  that the most of them are infidels having no understanding of 
                  Christ or his Gospel: hath given a special commandment that 
                  the said kind of people shall be with all speed avoided and 
                  discharged out of this her majesty's realms; and to that end 
                  and purpose hath appointed Casper van Senden, merchant of Lubeck, 
                  for their speedy transportation, a man that hath somewhat deserved 
                  of this realm in respect that by his own labor and charge he 
                  hath relieved and brought from Spain divers of our English nation 
                  who otherwise would have perished there. </td>

                  or his assignees to taking such Negroes and blackamoors to be 
                  transported as aforesaid as he shall find within the realm of 
                  England; and if there shall be any person or persons which be 
                  possessed of any such blackamoors that refuse to deliver them 
                  in sort aforesaid, then we require you to call them before you 
                  and to advise and persuade them by all good means to satisfy 
                  her majesty's pleasure therein; which if they shall eftsoons 
                  willfully and obstinately refuse, we pray you to certify their 
                  names to us, to the end her majesty may take such further course
