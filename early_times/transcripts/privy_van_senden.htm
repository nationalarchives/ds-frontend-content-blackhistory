                    of Lubeck did by his labor and travell procure 89 of her Ma[jest's] 
                    subiectes that were detayned prisoners in Spaine and Portugall 
                    to be released, and brought them hither into this Realme at 
                    his owne cost and charges, for the w[hi]ch his expences and 
                    declaration of his honest minde towardes those prizoners, 
                    he only desireth to have lycense to take up so many Blackamoores

                    a very good exchange and that those kinde of people may be
