                  it appears that there is no Place on the whole Coast of Africa 
                  where there can be any solid Security against Slavery. To depend 
                  on Arms what is a Small number of Men to do against a great 
                  force? But the notion of carrying Arms beyond a certain limitation 
                  implies a hostile Settlement, whereas Government certainly never 
                  meant any thing, but what is friendly, founded upon Principles 
                  of liberty and Sacred Rights which may, be derived from a Solemn 
                  Compact and Agreement for the security of such liberty, and 
                  consequently whatever is right to be done it is presumed Government 
                  will do.</td>

                <td colspan="2"><p>With respect to the deceased Mr. Smeathman, 
                    he had the art of telling his Story very well and represented 
                    things in the most favourable light, but in the latter days 
                    of his life he avowed his Intention of trafficking in Men, 
                    so far that he would buy though he would not sell. The Committee 
                    thought that his Judgment misled him, if not his heart; and 
                    if he had not changed his mind or said that he would acquiesce 
                    in the Sentiments of the Committee, the Committee would have 
                    certainly dropped any further connection with him. What his 
                    real Designs were when he should have landed in that Country 
                    and had nothing farther to hope or fear from the Committee, 
                    will be a subject for strong suspicion in the Breast of every 
                    Man concerned as long as they live. There were many other 
                    reasons why Mr. Smeathman would not have been considered as 
                    a fit and proper Person to be intrusted with the conduct of 
                    such an Enterprise, but he was the only one that offered, 
                    and since his death no one has appeared as a fit substitute, 
                    every one acquainted with the country hitherto thoughts of 
                    being either actually engaged in the Slave Trade, or entertaining 
                    an opinion as if it were not possible to make a Settlement 
                    without slaving. Indeed this was the language that Mr. Smeathman 
                    held only that he would upon no consideration sell the Man 
                    that he should buy, but unluckily nobody believed or had faith 
                    in such a Doctrine. To buy and forego all the advantages of 
                    selling was not credible. There is another great ambiguity 
                    respecting the Coast of Africa. The various accounts given 
                    leave many doubts. Mr. Smeathman himself brought from thence 
                    a Constitution which lasted him but a little while, and always 
                    seemed to be more anxious about his medical knowledge and 
                    Medicine Chest than his Tools for husbandry. To all appearance 
                    there will be much greater security for liberty and life and 
                    the Comforts arising from freedom and health in his Majesty's 
                    Dominions in New Brunswick than there can possibly be in any 
                    Part of the Coast of Africa. And the more as every comfort 
                    and necessary will be provided as setting off both of Food 
                    &amp; Raiment; and consequently with suitable labour in a 
                    soil professedly capable of producing the Necessaries of life, 
                    the comforts of it may be handed down from Generation to Generation 
                    under all the advantages of distributive Justice, the exercise 
                    of Humanity and obedience to be laws of Christ which may be 
                    found in that Country, the peaceful Government of which must 
                    be a security beyond any which the most sanguine hope can 
                    suggest respecting Africa.</p></td>
