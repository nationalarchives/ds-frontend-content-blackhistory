                  the Honourable Company's Dockyard, Bombay, was born in 1785; 
                  and entered the yard under his uncle, Framjee, then Master Builder, 
                  in 1800, as an apprentice in the shipwrights' line. He was promoted 
                  to Fourth Assistant Builder in 1805, in which capacity he had 
                  the superintendence (in conjunction with the other assistants) 
                  of all ships building and repairing in the Bombay docks. In 
                  1812 he was raised to the situation of Second Assistant; and, 
                  in 1817, to that of First Assistant. In 1821 became Second Builder, 
                  and as such, in 1831, received, as a mark of approbation, from 
                  the Honourable Court of Directors, a silver rule, in token of 
                  their estimation of the value of his services; and, finally, 
                  in 1844, was promoted to the very responsible situation of Head 
                  Builder at Bombay; his services embracing thus a period of nearly 
                  half a century.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course 
                  of this period upwards of one hundred large and small ships 
                  have been built for the Honourable Company, whilst for the service 
                  of the Crown there have been no less that ten line-of-battle 
                  ships, five frigates, and six brigs; also for his Highness the 
                  Imaum of Muscat one line-of-battle ship, two frigates, and five 
                  sloops, besides numerous vessels for the merchant service.<br> 
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of driving the 
                  silver nail in her Majesty's brig <em>Goshawk</em> (afterwards 
                  <em>Nerbudda</em>), he had the satisfaction of receiving a silver 
                  hammer from one of the senior members of the Government, the 
                  Honourable Mr. James Henry Crawford.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
                  person, Cursetjee Rustomjee is of the middle height, with a 
                  remarkably pleasing and intelligent countenance, and possesses 
                  great activity, notwithstanding his increasing years (his age 
                  being 63). He is deservedly treated with the greatest consideration 
                  by the government that he has for so long a period faithfully 
                  served.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the 
                  noble 80-gun ship, of which there are two Views. the <em>Meanee</em>, 
                  although a superintendent was appointed by the lords of the 
                  Admiralty (Mr. George Turner), with an assistant (Mr. William 
                  Ladd), to overlook the work and give the lines, the whole of 
                  the laborious part of the building of the ship was performed 
                  under the directions of Cursetjee Rustomjee and his assistants, 
                  Jehangeer and Herjeebhoy. The <em>Meanee</em> is built of picked 
                  timber, and very highly finished. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
                  are indebted for the accompanying Views and Portrait to Daguerr&eacute;otypes, 
                  cleverly taken by Mr. A. J. Roussac, of Bombay.</td>
