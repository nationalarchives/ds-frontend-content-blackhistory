                <td><p>As I have ever entertained Hopes, that an Accommodation 
                    might have taken Place between GREAT-BRITAIN and this Colony, 
                    without being compelled by my Duty to this most disagreeable 
                    but now absolutely necessary Step, rendered so by a Body of 
                    armed Men unlawfully assembled, firing on His MAJESTY'S Tenders, 
                    and the formation of an Army, and that Army now on their March 
                    to attack His MAJESTY'S Troops and destroy the well disposed 
                    Subjects of this Colony. To defeat such treasonable Purposes, 
                    and that all such Traitors, and their Abettors, may be brought 
                    to Justice, and that the Peace, and good Order of this Colony 
                    may be again restored, which the ordinary Course of the Civil 
                    Law is unable to effect; I have thought fit to issue this 
                    my Proclamation, hereby declaring, that until the aforesaid 
                    good Purposes can be obtained, I do in Virtue of the Power 
                    and Authority to ME given, by his MAJESTY, determine to execute 
                    Martial Law, and cause the same to be executed throughout 
                    this Colony: and to the end that Peace and good Order may 
                    the sooner be restored, I do require every Person capable 
                    of bearing Arms, to resort to His MAJESTY'S STANDARD, or be 
                    looked upon as Traitors to His MAJESTY'S Crown and Government, 
                    and thereby become liable to the Penalty the Law inflicts 
                    upon such Offences; such as forfeiture of Life, confiscation 
                    of Lands, etc., etc. And I do hereby further declare all indented 
                    Servants, Negroes, or others, (appertaining to Rebels,) free 
                    that are able and willing to bear Arms, they joining His MAJESTY'S 
                    Troops as soon as may be, for the more speedily reducing this 
                    Colony to a proper Sense of their Duty, to His MAJESTY'S Crown 
                    and Dignity. I do further order, and require, all His MAJESTY'S 
                    Leige Subjects, to retain their Quitrents, or any other Taxes 
                    due or that may become due, in their own Custody, till such 
                    Time as Peace may be again restored to this at present most 
                    unhappy Country, or demanded of them for their former salutary 
                    Purposes, by Officers properly authorised to receive the same.</p></td>
