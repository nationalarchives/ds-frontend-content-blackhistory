                  of the Queen Charlotte, 110 guns, recently paid off, it is now 
                  discovered, was a female African, who had served as a seaman 
                  in the royal navy for upwards of eleven years, several of which 
                  she has been rated able on the books of the above ship by the 
                  name of William Brown, and has served for some time as the captain 
                  of the fore-top, highly to the satisfaction of the officers. 
                  She is a smart well formed-figure, about five feet four inches 
                  in height, possessed of considerable strength and great activity; 
                  her features are rather handsome for a black, and she appears 
                  to be about 26 years of age. Her share of prize money is said 
                  to be considerable, respecting which she has been several times 
                  within the last few days at Somerset-place. In her manner she 
                  exhibits all the traits of a British tar, and takes her grog 
                  with her late messmates with the greatest gaiety. She says she 
                  is a married woman and went to sea in consequence of a quarrel 
                  with her husband, who, it is said, has entered a caveat against 
                  her receiving her prize money. She declares her intention of 
                  again entering the service as a volunteer.</td>
