          <td>The <em>Annual Register</em> for 1815 reveals that a Black sailor, 
            William Brown, 'recently' paid off from HMS <em>Queen Charlotte</em> 
            with the rest of the crew, was a woman. It was not unheard of in the 
            18th and 19th centuries for women to disguise themselves as men and 
            join the Royal Navy - and some even managed to serve in this way for 
            many years. <br>
            <br>
            According to the <em>Annual Register</em>, Brown was an experienced 
            sailor. She had served on the <em>Queen Charlotte</em> for a number 
            of years as an able seaman and had been promoted to 'captain 
            of the fore-top', in charge of other sailors assigned to that 
            particular part of the ship. <br>
            <br>
            However, the muster lists for the crew of the <em>Queen Charlotte</em> 
            tell a different story. When its crew was 'paid off' on 23 August 
            1815, only one of them was called William Brown; but he was a 32-year-old 
            Scot who had joined the <em>Queen Charlotte</em> little more than 
            a month earlier from HMS <em>Cumberland</em>. No reference has been 
            found to the appointment of any William Brown to 'captain of the fore-top' 
            on the <em>Queen Charlotte</em>. There is, however, one intriguing 
            reference in the muster lists that supports part of the of the <em>Annual 
            Register</em>'s report. It is recorded, in the extract reproduced 
            here, that 21-year-old William Brown from Grenada joined the crew 
            of the <em>Queen Charlotte</em> on 23 May 1815 as a landsman (the 
            least experienced class of rating) and was discharged on 19 June 1815, 
            'being a female.' <br>
            <br>
            Neither the muster lists nor the <em>Annual Register</em> record the 
            real names of their female sailors.<br>
