          <td>This drawing from the <em>Illustrated London News</em> shows Cursetjee 
            Rustomjee, head builder in 1849 at the East India Company shipyard 
            at Bombay. Its accompanying article follows his career from entry 
            into the shipyard as a 15-year-old apprentice in 1800. <br>
            <br>
            Cursetjee Rustomjee was a member of the Wadia family of master shipbuilders, 
            who had been designing and building ships for both the East India 
            Company and the Royal Navy for generations. His uncle, to whom he 
            had been apprenticed, was head builder at the shipyard before him. 
            He was also related to Bomanjee Jamsetjee, whose report to the Royal 
            Navy on the building of HMS <em>Cornwallis</em> in 1812 can also be 
            seen on this web page. <br>
            <br>
            The article also lists the number of ships built in the almost 50 
            year period that Cursetjee Rustomjee worked at the shipyard. Members 
            of the Wadia family would undoubtedly have been involved in the work 
            on all of these.<br>
