          <td><p>William Affleck was born on the island of St Kitts and enlisted 
              in the British army in 1801 in Hounslow, Middlesex. In 1819, he 
              was discharged on the grounds of poor health, having spent almost 
              all of his army career as a trumpeter. <br>
              <br>
              Discharge papers, such as Affleck's, are now the main (and 
              sometimes the only) source of information about individual soldiers. 
              These papers were retained by the army whenever a soldier was discharged 
              with a pension. But the majority of rank-and-file soldiers, both 
              Black and White, were ineligible for a pension, so their service 
              records were destroyed after their discharge from the army. It is 
              therefore impossible to tell exactly how many soldiers in the British 
              army were Black. <br>
              <br>
              In order to identify individual Black soldiers among the discharge 
              papers that were retained, it is necessary to search for indicators 
              of race within the records themselves. We only know that William 
              Affleck was Black because, in addition to specifying his birthplace, 
              his service record states that he was of 'black Complexion'.
