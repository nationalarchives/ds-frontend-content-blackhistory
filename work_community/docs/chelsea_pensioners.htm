          <td><p>This painting, entitled <em>Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Gazette 
              after the Battle of Waterloo</em>, by Scottish artist Sir David 
              Wilkie, was commissioned by the Duke of Wellington and shows a group 
              of wounded, invalided and elderly soldiers celebrating the British 
              victory at Waterloo. Presumably, they are reading the <em>London 
              Gazette</em>, an official publication that included army despatches 
              and reports of military engagements. Within the group there is a 
              Black soldier, in what looks like a musician's uniform, as 
              well as a soldier from India (although it is unlikely that this 
              soldier is Asian). <br>
              <br>
              In his notes composed when the painting was first shown at the Royal 
              Academy, in 1822, Wilkie describes the Black soldier as: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>'...one of the band of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, who 
                was in France during the Revolution; was present at the death 
                of Louis XVI, and was afterwards servant to General Moreau, in 
                his campaigns in Germany...'</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He does not, however, give the soldier's name.<br>
