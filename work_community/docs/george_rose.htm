          <td>George Rose was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica and was recruited 
            into the 73rd Regiment of Foot in 1809. Apart from a period of about 
            16 months in 1822-3, he appears to have had a non-musical career in 
            the army before being discharged, with the rank of Sergeant, in 1837. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These pages have been taken from Rose's army discharge papers. What 
            else do they tell us about him? We know that Rose was Black because 
            he is described as a 'man of colour', with a 'copper complexion'. 
            We know that he served in Europe and on various Mediterranean islands, 
            but that most of his time in the army was spent at home (i.e. in Britain). 
            We know that Rose was wounded at the Battle of Waterloo and during 
            another engagement during the Napoleonic wars. Also, that in common 
            with other Waterloo veterans, including <a href="william_affleck.htm">William 
            Affleck</a>, two bonus years were added to the calculation of time 
            served in the army for pension purposes. <br>
            <br>
            However, it doesn't tell us how 18-year-old Rose came to be 
            in Northern Ireland, where he enlisted in the British army. Nor does 
            it indicate what subsequently happened to a 45-year-old labourer with 
            a weakened left arm, once he left the army.<br>
