              Liverpool</h3>
            <p>Liverpool took over from Bristol as the country&#8217;s major slave 
              trading port in the mid 17th century.</p>
            <p>In the 16th century, Liverpool had been just one of Britain&#8217;s 
              many ports and had not been as quick as London or Bristol to seize 
              the opportunities presented by the Slave Trade.</p>
            <p>Liverpool merchants eventually undercut London and Bristol by a 
              combination of price-cutting measures such as employing younger 
              sailors on less pay and taking advantage of the superior harbour 
              and docking facilities of the Mersey. Bristol merchants also had 
              to deal with the problem of low tides and silting on the way to 
              their harbour.</p>
            <p>As well as a five-fold increase in its population, a Black and 
              Asian presence in Liverpool was the consequence of this commercial 
              activity. Black and Asian servants, sailors, runaways and others 
              lived and remained in Liverpool.<br>

            <p><img src="../images/liverpool/goree.jpg" alt="The Goree road sign" width="142" height="71" hspace="20" align="right" class="frame">By
               the late 18th century, Britain accounted for half the world&#8217;s
                transatlantic slave voyages, with Liverpool accounting for 60%
               of  Britain&#8217;s share. During the 18th century, Liverpool&#8217;s
                population had grown from just 5,000 to 78,000. This dramatic
               growth  was achieved on the back of Liverpool&#8217;s involvement
               in the  slave trade.</p>
            <p>It is said that in the docks area of Liverpool, ships trading with 
              Africa, the Caribbean and America would berth three to four deep 
              along the quays. Today, the Albert Dock is home to the Merseyside 
              Maritime Museum, which houses the transatlantic slave gallery. Running 
              parallel to Pier Head is the Strand, formerly known as the Goree 
              Piazza. Goree is named after the island off the coast of Senegal, 
              West Africa, which was used as a base to trade for slaves.<br>

               building was built in 1927 as the headquarters of Martin&#8217;s
                Bank. The origins of this bank lie in the establishment of Heywood&#8217;s
                 Bank, formed by Benjamin and Arthur Heywood, who became wealthy
                 through the slave trade and set up the bank to enable others
                to  do so as well. Heywood&#8217;s Bank was incorporated into
                the Bank of Liverpool, which was incorporated into Martin&#8217;s
                Bank before being incorporated, in turn, into Barclay&#8217;s

            <p>This art gallery, built between 1874 and 1877, has on display several 
              paintings featuring the Black presence. These include &#8216;<em>The 
              Hunted Slaves</em>&#8217; by Richard Ansell, painted in 1861 and 
              &#8216;<em>The Family of Sir William Young</em>&#8217; by Johann 
              Zoffany, painted about 1770, which features a young, Black servant 
              boy. There is also a painting of William Roscoe, the anti-slavery 
              campaigner who was MP for Liverpool.</p>
            <p>The gallery also displays &#8216;<em>The Death of Nelson</em>&#8217; 
              by Daniel Maclise, painted between 1859 and 1864. It features a
                 Black sailor pointing out a sniper at the Battle of Trafalgar
                 in 1805. Is this the same Black sailor who appears in the sculpture
                 at the foot of Nelson&#8217;s Column in Trafalgar Square, London?<br>

              This painting by Daniel Maclise is a replica of a fresco that is 
              in the Royal Gallery of the Houses of Parliament (see London) and 
              shows an Black sailor pointing out a French sniper to a sharpshooter. 
              Perhaps he is pointing out the sniper who has fatally wounded Vice 
              Admiral Nelson. This painting differs slightly from the sculpture 
              below Nelson&#8217;s Column in London but is yet again proof that 
              Black and Asian men fought in the military in some of Britain&#8217;s 
              most famous battles. For the possible identity of the Black sailor, 
              see Nelson's Column, London. On the left of the painting there is 
              also another Black sailor providing comfort to the wounded.</p>
