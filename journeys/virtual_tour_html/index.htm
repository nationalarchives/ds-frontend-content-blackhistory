              Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Black and Asian presence in Britain is not a recent one. Black 
              and Asian people have lived, worked and died in Britain for 500 
              years or more. </p>
            <p>They have contributed to the wealth, development and history of 
              this country, directly and indirectly helping put the Great into 
              Great Britain.</p>
            <p>The evidence of this long Black and Asian presence has largely 
              been hidden for many years but it is out there if you look hard 
              enough.</p>
            <p>This learning journey is designed to help you discover for yourself 
              how evidence of 500 years of Black and Asian presence can be found 
              around you in the physical landscape, as well as in books, pictures 
              and documents. It uses three cities, London, Bristol and Liverpool 
              as examples of places where the Black and Asian presence in Britain&#8217;s 
              history can be located.</p>
            <p>Before you enter this site: challenge yourself to see if you can 
              think of a single monument or a piece of physical evidence that 
              proves that Black and Asian people have been a continuous presence 
              in Britain from at least the 16th century.</p>
