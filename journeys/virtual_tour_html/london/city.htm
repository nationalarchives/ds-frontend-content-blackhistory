            <p>Number 38, Threadneedle Street.</p>
            <p>The South Sea Company launched in 1710 had its headquarters on 
              the corner of Threadneedle Street and Bishopsgate. In 1713, under 
              the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained from France the 
              right, known as the Asiento, to supply slaves to the Spanish colonies. 
              The South Sea Company was chosen to carry out the terms of the Asiento 
              regarding the transportation of slaves and had the backing of the 
              Royal family who were the official contractors. The company is most 
              famous for causing the economic crisis known as the &#8216;South 
              Sea Bubble&#8217; which caused Britain to rethink its economic policy 
              at the time.</p>

              the slave trade. </p>
            <p>In his early years, he made several slave trading voyages to Africa 
              and the West Indies, later recording his experiences as a slave 
              trader in a book, <em>The Journal of a Slave Trader (John Newton) 
              1750-1754</em>. His writings were later used in the campaign against 
              the slave trade.</p>
            <p>John Newton is known today as the composer of the hymn &#8216;Amazing

            <p>Number 12, St Michael&#8217;s Alley.</p>
            <p>This building, now a wine bar, is the site of London&#8217;s first 
              coffee house. Built in 1652 it was called the <em>Pasqua Rosee</em>. 
              The whole alley was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 
              but a new coffee house was built in 1668. The name Jamaica most 
              likely referred to Britain&#8217;s recent acquisition of the island 
              of Jamaica with its sugar plantations.</p>
            <p>London had over 2,000 coffee houses. They were places where traders 
              met to discuss business and arrange loans, advertise the sale of 
              slaves or put up notices for the capture of runaway slaves. A notice 
              for 8 August 1728 shows a two guinea reward offered at the Jamaica 
              Coffee House for a runaway Black female slave called Caelia Edlyne.<br>

            <p>On this site stood the headquarters of the East India Company. 
              The company was set up in 1600, in the reign of Elizabeth I to expand 
              Britain&#8217;s trade in spices and other goods with the Indian 
              subcontinent.</p>
            <p><br>
              The company&#8217;s influence in India grew spectacularly and even 
              the British government found it difficult to control its activities.</p>
            <p><br>
              Investors and employees of the company could become wealthy very 
              quickly and lived luxurious lifestyles.</p>
            <p><br>
              Many brought Asian servants back to Britain with them after working 
              in India with the company and ships from India worked by Lascar 
              seamen brought Asians to live in London and other places.<br>

              was dominated by the activities of the East India Company, which 
              had warehouses and drilling grounds for company soldiers nearby.
