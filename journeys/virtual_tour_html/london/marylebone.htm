              <em>Yorkshire Stingo</em> public house </h4>
            <p>In the 1780s, Asian seamen (Lascars), who had been employed by 
              the East India Company to serve on ships bringing goods from India, 
              were often left stranded in London and other ports without any means 
              of support. By 1785, there were so many left destitute, begging 
              and dying on the streets of London, that some philanthropists organised 
              &#8216;Subscribers for the relief of the distressed Blacks&#8217; 
              to help them. The scope of the subscription was widened to include 
              Black people from Africa and the Caribbean and became known as the 
              &#8216;Committee for the Relief of the Black poor&#8217;. It was 
              this body that launched a scheme to relocate as many of the capital&#8217;s 
              Black and Asian poor to a settlement in Sierra Leone.</p>
            <p>Whilst awaiting resettlement, Black and Asian people assembled 
              every Saturday at two locations to receive their six pennies a day 
              subscription. One place was the <em>White Raven</em> public house 
              in Mile End, the other being the <em>Yorkshire Stingo</em> public 
              house in Lisson Green, Paddington. It is possible that hundreds 
              of the Black poor visited these premises every Saturday.</p>
            <p>It is possible to find the minutes of the meetings of the Committee 
              for the Relief of the Black Poor in the Treasury records, which 
              are held at The National Archives. These records also include details 
              of the Black, Asian and White people who were on the lists of those 
              to be resettled. </p>

                    of the eight headmen or &#8216;corporals&#8217; appointed 
                    by the Committee for the Relief of the Black poor was an Asian 
                    man called John Lemon, aged 29 years, who had been born in 
                    Bengal. Each corporal was responsible for the good behaviour 
                    of a group or &#8216;company&#8217; of the Black poor and 
                    for payment of their daily allowance. It is likely John Lemon 
                    was in charge of the Lascars.<br>
                    <br>
                    It also provides an example of how Asian people are often 
                    described as &#8216;black&#8217; in the documents and demonstrates 
                    why the historical researcher must be careful when interpreting 
                    evidence of the Black and Asian presence.<br>

            <p>The Coffee House at number 34, George Street near the fashionable 
              Portman Square, was London&#8217;s first Indian restaurant opened 
              in 1810, by Sake Dean Mahomed. The restaurant was aimed at London&#8217;s 
              many Anglo-Indians and offered authentic Asian dishes in an oriental 
              setting.</p>
            <p>Mahomed came from a wealthy family in Bihar, India but embarked 
              upon a military career with the East India Company. After a long 
              career in the army, he moved to Ireland where he lived for many 
              years. Mahomed later moved to England, working in a vapour bath 
              where he introduced the Indian treatment &#8216;champi&#8217; or 
              &#8216;shampooing&#8217;.</p>
            <p>In 1794, he wrote a book entitled <em>The Travels of Dean Mahomet</em>. 
              He later moved to Brighton to set up his own vapour bath establishment 
              and wrote a book on the art of shampooing in 1822. He died in 1851 
              and was buried in St Nicholas' churchyard in Brighton.<br>

              Equiano led a remarkable life. At the age of 11 years, he was kidnapped 
              in what is now Nigeria and taken as a slave to Barbados. Between 
              1757 to 1763 he went with his master on naval service to the Caribbean, 
              the Mediterranean and North America before arriving in England where 
              he was taught to read and write. His master, fearing that Equiano 
              would assert his freedom, re-sold him in the Americas. This did 
              not deter Equiano, who finally purchased his own freedom in 1766. 
              He returned to Britain and spent his next 11 years as a merchant 
              seaman, travelling to Greenland and other places. Equiano travelled 
              up and down the country campaigning against slavery and in 1789 
              wrote his life story, <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life 
              of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa, the African</em>. This book 
              was used in the campaign against the slave trade. Equiano was also 
              appointed as commissary of stores in the plan to resettle the Black poor in Sierra Leone but he was dismissed for exposing corruption.</p>
            <p>In 2000, Westminster Council unveiled a plaque commemorating the 
              fact that Equiano had lived at number 73, Riding House Street, Westminster. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The plaque reads &quot;Olaudah Equiano (1745 - 1797) &quot;The 
              African&quot; lived and published here in 1789 his autobiography 
              on suffering the barbarity of slavery, which paved the way for its 
              abolition&quot;.</p>
