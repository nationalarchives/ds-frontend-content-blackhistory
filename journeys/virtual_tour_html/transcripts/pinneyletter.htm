      <p>London<br>
        Dear Madam<br>
        Bristol May 23rd 1798<br>
        I received Miss Jones&#8217;s kind favor yesterday too late for a reply 
        by return of Post. In order to save you the Postage of a letter from T. 
        P &amp; T at their request I enclose a draft for &pound;25 and they will 
        take care to remit you the &pound;125 on the first of July.<br>
        I think your landlord has behaved handsome in only charging you &pound;5.13.0. 
        additional Rent for I know not where you would have suited yourself so 
        well.<br>
        I should be exceedingly concerned to hear that a single weekley Bill was 
        left unpaid. It must be your own fault if that should ever be the case.<br>
        I am happy to tell you that my Grandson is a fine Boy, christened Evan 
        after his Grandfather Baillie my Daughter Baillie and every branch of 
        my family save my Son Charles who has a Cold are perfectly well. I must 
        also except my Servant Pero who is very ill and now at Ashton for change 
        of Air, I much doubt his recovery. One or other of us visit him three 
        or four times a week. He has waited on my Person upwards of thirty two 
        years, and I cannot help feeling much for him: notwithstanding he has 
        not lately conducted himself as well as I could have wished.<br>
        If I visit London it will be for the sole purpose of paying my respects 
        to you: and you may rest assured, if I conveniently can, in the course 
        of the summer I will do it. All my family unite in love to you and Miss 
        Jones with Dear Madam my best respects and kind remembrance to Mr. And 
        Mrs. Barton.<br>
        Your ever Affect[io]n[ately]<br>
