        SACRED to the memory of<br>
        GRANVILLE SHARP,<br>
        ninth son of Dr. Thomas Sharp,<br>
        Prebendary of the cathedrals and collegiate churches of York, Durham, 
        and Southwell,<br>
        and grandson of Dr John Sharp, Archbishop of York.<br>
        Born and educated in the bosom of the Church of England,<br>
        he ever cherished for her institutions the most unshaken regard,<br>
        while his whole soul was in harmony with the sacred strain<br>
        &#8220;Glory to GOD in the highest, on earth peace goodwill towards men.&#8221;<br>
        on which his life presented one beautiful comment<br>
        of glowing piety, and unwearied beneficence.<br>
        Freed by competence from the necessity, and by content from the desire,<br>
        of lucrative occupation.<br>
        He was incessant in his labours to improve the condition of mankind.<br>
        Founding public happiness on public virtue,<br>
        he aimed to rescue his native country from the guilt and inconsistency<br>
        of employing the arm of freedom to rivet the fetters of bondage.<br>
        And established for the Negro race, in the person of Somerset,<br>
        the long disputed rights of human nature.<br>
        Having, in this glorious cause, triumphed over the combined resistance<br>
        of interest, prejudice, and pride,<br>
        he took his post among the foremost of the honourable band<br>
        associated to deliver AFRICA from the rapacity of EUROPE<br>
        by the abolition of the slave trade;<br>
        nor was death permitted to interrupt his career of usefulness<br>
        till he had witnessed that Act of the British Parliament<br>
        by which &#8220;THE ABOLITION&#8221; was decreed.<br>
        In, his private relations he was equally exemplary,<br>
        and having exhibited through life a model of disinterested virtue,<br>
        he resigned his pious spirit into the hands of his creator<br>
        in the exercise of charity, and faith, and hope,<br>
        on the sixth day of July, A.D. 1813,<br>
        in the 78th year of his age.</p>

        thou should&#8217;st be disposed to suspect it as partial, or to censure
