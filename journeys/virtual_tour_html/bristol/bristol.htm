              Bristol</h3>
            <p>Bristol had the second largest port after London and between 1720s and 1740s became Britain&#8217;s leading slaving port.</p>
            <p>As a result of this trade, Bristol grew rapidly in population and 
              size. It soon became Britain&#8217;s second city after London.</p>
            <p>Ships from Bristol sailed to all parts of the globe carrying goods 
              made in Bristol or its surrounding areas. These goods were used 
              to buy slaves from Africa in return for money or produce for further 
              sale in Britain or for re-export elsewhere.</p>
            <p>This trade made some Bristolians very rich. You can see evidence 
              of this wealth and the legacy of this trade all around you in Bristol.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Black and Asian people came to Bristol as slaves, 
              servants, sailors or visitors and their history, inextricably linked 
              to the development of the slave trade and later Britain&#8217;s 
              empire, can be found around Bristol too.<br>

              In 1999 this footbridge was opened in the docks area of Bristol. 
              It was named after an African slave who had been purchased in Nevis 
              in the West Indies by the plantation owner John Pinney, who named 
              him Pero Jones. Pinney brought Pero back with him when he moved 
              to England in 1783. Pero lived, worked and died in Bristol. </p>

              John Pinney&#8217;s house at number 7, Great George Street (see 
              the Georgian House) in Bristol, where there is a display on the

              1663, the Company of Royal Adventurers, later known as the Royal 
              African Company, produced a gold coin called a guinea. They traded 
              in slaves and delivered gold obtained from the West African coast 
              to the Mint, where it was turned into coinage. Bristol also produced

              who made a voyage around the world in 1708 to 1711 trading in slaves 
              on the way. He also invested in a ship carrying slaves from Africa 
              to Jamaica.</p>

            <p>The first overseas Consulate for the USA was located in the square

            <p>On this site stood the Merchants&#8217; Hall, the headquarters
               of the Society of Merchant Venturers who ensured that Bristol&#8217;s
                merchant traders took full advantage of the burgeoning trade
               in  African slaves during the 18th century. A plaque commemorating
               the  Society is on the wall of the current office block.</p>

              door (and shown here) are situated the Merchant Venturers&#8217; 
              Almshouses, built by the Society for sick and elderly sailors. On 
              the wall you can see the coat of arms of the Society. From here 
              you can walk along King Street, which was built in the 17th century. 
              Residents included many who owed their wealth to the slave trade 
              and the Theatre Royal's many patrons were Merchant Venturers. Thomas 
              Clarkson, the abolitionist, visited here to gather information for 
              use in the campaign against the trade.</p>
