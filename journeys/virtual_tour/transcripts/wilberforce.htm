        To the memory of<br>
        WILLIAM WILBERFORCE<br>
        (born in Hull August 24th 1759<br>
        died in London July 29th 1833)<br>
        For nearly half a century a member of the House of Commons,<br>
        and, for six Parliaments during that period,<br>
        one of the two representatives for Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>In an age and country fertile in great and good men,<br>
        he was among the foremost of those who fixed the character of their times;<br>
        because to high and various talents,<br>
        to warm benevolence, and to universal candour,<br>
        he added the abiding eloquence of a Christian life.</p>
      <p>Eminent as he was in every department of public labour,<br>
        and a leader in every work of charity,<br>
        whether to relieve the temporal or the spiritual wants of his fellow-men,<br>
        his name will ever be specially identified<br>
        with those exertions<br>
        which, by the blessing of GOD, removed from England<br>
        the guilt of the African slave trade,<br>
        and prepared the way for the abolition of slavery<br>
        in every colony of the empire:</p>
      <p>In the prosecution of these objects<br>
        he relied, not in vain, on GOD;<br>
        but in the process he was called to endure<br>
        great obloquy and great opposition:<br>
        he outlived, however, all enmity;<br>
        and in the evening of his days,<br>
        withdrew from public life and public observation<br>
        to the bosom of his family.<br>
        Yet he died not unnoticed or forgotten by his country:<br>
        The peers and commons of England,<br>
        with the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker at their head,<br>
        in solemn procession from their respective houses,<br>
        carried him to his fitting place<br>
        among the mighty dead around,<br>
        here to repose:</p>
      <p>Till, through the merits of JESUS CHRIST,<br>
        his only redeemer and saviour,<br>
        (whom, in his life and in his writings he had desired to glorify,)<br>
        he shall rise in the resurrection of the just.<br>
