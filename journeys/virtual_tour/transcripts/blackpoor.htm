        that in consequence of his Promise made to the Blacks and People of Colour 
        on Saturday, he had digested a Paper (a Printed Copy whereof is annexed) 
        as an Instrument of Agreement, which he thought competent for the Purpose 
        of the most unequivocal Understanding.</p>
      <p>That a Ninth Man, said to be a Person of weight among the Blacks, left 
        the Room saying he would consider of it; but the Eight Persons declared 
        they were satisfied, and that they considered it as the fairest and most 
        just Agreement</p>
      <p>Agreement that ever was made between White and Black People, and hoped 
        that he (as the Present Chairman) would recommend it in the strongest 
        Terms to the Approbation of the Committee.<br>
