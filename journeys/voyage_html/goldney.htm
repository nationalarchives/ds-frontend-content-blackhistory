      <h4>Thomas Goldney I, Thomas Goldney II and Thomas Goldney III</h4>
      <p>In 1637, Thomas Goldney was sent by his father from Chippenham in Wiltshire 
        to Bristol as an apprentice. At the time Bristol was a corporation town, 
        which meant that anyone who wished to practice a trade had to be a freeman 
        first. To become a freeman, Thomas Goldney had to serve as an apprentice 
        for seven years. In fact, he served his apprenticeship for almost nine 
        years. On 22 June 1646, therefore, he paid his fee and became a freeman 
        of the city. In the same year, Goldney married Mary Clements, set himself 
        up as a grocer and moved to High Street, near Bristol Bridge.</p>
      <p>In time, both Thomas Goldney and his wife Mary joined the Society of 
        Friends, better known as the Quakers. They were both active in the society, 
        suffering fines and imprisonment for their beliefs. Nevertheless, Goldney 
        prospered as a trader. In 1674, he bought a country estate at Elberton, 
        Gloucestershire. Situated about ten miles from Bristol for &pound;700, 
        he derived income from it in the form of rents. Financial difficulties, 
        however, forced him to lease out the estate in 1681 to his son-in-law, 
        James Wallis.</p>
      <p>In 1688, Thomas Goldney built four houses on land that was formerly known 
        as Castle Precincts. He took one of these houses for himself, leaving 
        his house in High Street for one of his sons, Thomas Goldney II and his 
        wife. Thomas Goldney I died in 1694 and Mary died in 1709.</p>

      <h4>Thomas Goldney II</h4>
      <p>Thomas Goldney II was born in Bristol in 1664. In 1687, he married Hannah 
        Speed, the daughter of Richard Speed, a Bristol merchant. In the following 
        year, 1688, Thomas achieved the freedom of the city by virtue of being 
        the son of a free burgess. After his father moved to Castle Green, Thomas 
        and Hannah moved to the Goldney home in High Street, near Bristol Bridge 
        where, like his father, he prospered as a grocer. Thomas Goldney II also 
        derived income from other business interests. He owned shares in ships, 
        held land at Clevedon, farmland at Elberton, and acted as an agent for 
        the Collector of Customs for the port of Bristol. By 1694, Goldney was 
        able to lease a country house in Clifton, now known as Goldney Hall. </p>

      <p>Over the next few years, Goldney was involved in a number of lawsuits, 
        one of which led to his imprisonment from 1708 to 1710 for alleged non-payment 
        of a debt. Before his imprisonment, however, Thomas Goldney II had become 
        the principal shareholder in a voyage from Bristol, led by Captain Woodes 
        Rogers. The voyage, from 1708 to 1711, was a privateering enterprise by 
        two ships, the <em>Duke</em> and the <em>Dutchess</em>. It was extremely 
        successful: in return for his initial investment of &pound;3,726 Goldney 
        received &pound;6,800, a huge amount by today&#8217;s standards.</p>

      <p>In 1713, Thomas Goldney made a large investment in the iron works at 
        Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, about 80 miles from Bristol. Abraham Darby 
        I had been experimenting at the works, smelting iron with coke instead 
        of charcoal. The costs involved in this process, however, were beginning 
        to worry Darby&#8217;s backers. This problem was partly solved in April 
        1713 when Abraham Darby I mortgaged half of the Coalbrookdale works to 
        Thomas Goldney II for &pound;1,700.</p>

      <h4> Thomas Goldney III</h4>
      <p>Thomas Goldney III was born in 1696 in the country home at Clifton. He 
        was given a good education, after the completion of which he was apprenticed 
        to his parents in 1711. From this time on, he received first hand experience 
        of the family business and learned to keep accounts. After Abraham Darby 
        I died in 1717, Thomas Goldney II took the younger Thomas with him to 
        the Coalbrookdale works to manage the accounts. The younger Thomas&#8217; 
        task was to: make sure the production of both pig iron and cast iron goods 
        was maintained to existing customers; to make sure the goods were delivered; 
        to collect payment; take further orders; procure more raw materials; to 
        safeguard the cash and to keep the books.</p>
      <p>Goldney himself was involved in a number of business partnerships and 
        investments that greatly increased his reputation, wealth and influence. 
        He was a backer of the Willey furnace, across the River Severn from Coalbrookdale, 
        which produced quality pig iron. Goldney was also a partner in the Bersham 
        furnace near Wrexham, which supplied iron to the Chester and North Wales 
        trades. The iron works at Coalbrookdale not only produced pig iron but 
        also hollow ware, mortars and pestles, railings and parts forNewcomen 
        engines, cannon and shot. Another venture at Warmley produced copper, 
        brass, spelter and utensils.</p>
      <p>In 1750, in partnership with William Champion, Thomas Goldney III invested 
        in a mining enterprise at Gronant in Flintshire. The mine was primarily 
        intended for the mining of lead, copper ore and calamine. The mines proved 
        to be a successful venture, leading to other mining investments at Kellyn, 
        Whitford and in Devon, Cornwall and Ireland.</p>
      <p>In 1751, Goldney expanded into the shipping business. He bought shares 
        in three ships, which brought iron goods from Coalbrookdale to Bristol 
        and then onto Ireland, Devon and Cornwall. The shipping side of the Goldney 
        business served to transport, supply and integrate the various industries 
        he had investments in. It is also for this reason that Thomas Goldney 
        III ventured into the banking business. In 1752, he entered into a banking 
        partnership with five associates, founding a bank called Goldney, Smith 
        and Co. This was one of the first six banks established in the whole country. 
        After the deaths of the partners, the bank went through a series of amalgamations. 
        First, it became Miles&#8217; Bank, then Harford&#8217;s Bank. It later 
        merged with Old Bank before merging with the National Westminster Bank, 
        which is today part of the Royal Bank of Scotland.<br>
      </p>
      In 1754, Thomas Goldney III provided the finance for Abraham Darby II&#8217;s 
      construction of a new furnace at Horsehay, two miles north of Coalbrookdale. 
      This proved such a success that a second furnace was opened at Horsehay 
      in 1756. In the same year a new furnace was built two miles north of Horsehay 
      at Ketley. The need for Thomas Goldney III and Abraham Darby II to integrate 
      their industrial enterprises led to the development, in 1757, of a railway 
      network to transport goods between the works. By 1757, five miles of wooden 
      railway for wagons with cast-iron wheels had been laid.

        Thomas Goldney III died in 1768, ending a 50-year association with the 
        Coalbrookdale works. He died leaving no son or heir but left his shares 
        in the works to his surviving family. They retained their interest in 
        the company until 1773 when they sold their interests to Abraham Darby 
        III for &pound;10,000. The Goldney shares in Ketley and Horsehay were 
        brought in 1775 by the manager of Coalbrookdale, Richard Reynolds, ending 
        the long association of the Goldney family with the Darby family and Coalbrookdale. 
        In the same year, 1775, a group of subscribers formed a company with the 
        intention of building a bridge across the River Severn. Abraham Darby 
        III proposed that a bridge made entirely of cast iron be built at Coalbrookdale. 
        The proposal was accepted and in 1779, the world&#8217;s first iron bridge 
        was completed. On New Year&#8217;s Day in 1781, the bridge was opened 
        to the public.</p>

        well as his long association with the Darby family and Coalbrookdale, 
        Thomas Goldney III is also know for enlarging and improving both the grounds 
        and interior of his home in Clifton. The house, known as Goldney Hall, 
        is today visited by thousands of people every year. The Grotto, built 
        at enormous expense by Goldney to entertain his wealthy friends, is a 
        grade 1 listed building. It is a unique construction and is one of many 
        follies in the superb landscaped gardens. The gardens also contain a gothic 
        tower which houses a steam pump produced at Coalbrookdale that was used 
        to irrigate his estate. There is also a bastion, a rotunda and an ornamental 
        canal.</p>
