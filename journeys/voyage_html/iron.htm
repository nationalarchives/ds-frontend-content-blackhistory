      <h4>Abraham Darby I, Abraham Darby II and Abraham Darby III</h4>
      <p>At the beginning of the 18th century there was a shortage of wood, the 
        main material used for making the charcoal that fired the blast furnaces, 
        so the industry suffered. Iron producers were reduced to importing pig 
        iron from abroad to keep the industry going. </p>
      <p>This situation changed when Abraham Darby I, operating from the Coalbrookdale 
        ironworks in Shropshire, developed the use of coal that had been turned 
        into coke instead of charcoal in the blast furnaces there. To enable an 
        expansion of the iron works at Coalbrookdale, Abraham Darby I entered 
        into a business partnership with Thomas Goldney II.</p>

      <p>Some historians have called this development &#8216;the spark that ignited 
        the Industrial Revolution&#8217; as it led, in the long term, to a massive 
        increase in the production of quality pig iron and wrought iron. Abraham 
        Darby II continued the partnership with the Goldney family, which enabled 
        the iron works to expand and diversify their output.</p>
      <p>The 
        ironworks at Coalbrookdale left a lasting imprint on Britain&#8217;s economic 
        development. In 1775, a group of subscribers formed a company with the 
        intention of constructing a bridge across the River Severn. They accepted 
        a proposal from Abraham Darby III and the Coalbrookdale works to build 
        the world&#8217;s first iron bridge in cast iron. </p>
     
      <p><img src="images/bridge_iron.jpg" alt="Detail of ironwork on the iron bridge" width="150" height="177" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="left" class="frame">In 
        1779, the Iron Bridge was completed and open to the public in 1781. Even 
        today, the bridge attracts visitors from around the world as a symbol 
        of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. It should not be forgotten that, 
        as well as the Iron Bridge, the Coalbrookdale works were responsible for: 
        the first experiments using coke for smelting iron instead of charcoal 
        in 1708; making the cylinders for the first steam engine in 1722; iron 
        wheels for railway wagons were introduced in 1729 and iron railway track 
        in 1767. The world&#8217;s first railway locomotive was built by the company 
        in 1802 to 1803 for Richard Trevithickwhile the huge ceremonial gates 
        which the company produced for the Great Exhibition of 1851, can be still 
        be seen today in Hyde Park, London.</p>
