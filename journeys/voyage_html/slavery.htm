        ships had been involved in the trade for slaves since the 1550s. London 
        was for many years the major port for slave-trading voyages before being 
        overtaken by Bristol in the early 18th century. Bristol itself was later 
        eclipsed by the port of Liverpool, which dominated slave-trading activities 
        until the abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807. At the time of the Woodes 
        Rogers voyage in 1708, Bristol was emerging out of London&#8217;s shadow 
        to become the country&#8217;s major slave trading port. The ending of 
        the Royal African Company&#8217;s monopoly in the trade for slaves in 
        1698 had accelerated Bristol&#8217;s involvement in the Slave Trade. Bristol 
        was also well placed to provide all the necessary manufactured goods needed 
        to trade in Africa for slaves, for example brass, iron, wool and glass. 
        After the slaves obtained in Africa had been sold for goods including 
        sugar, rum and tobacco, the slave-produced sugar was refined in Bristol&#8217;s 
        many sugarhouses and the slave-produced tobacco stimulated growth in the 
        pipe-making industries. Bristol&#8217;s population grew from 20,000 in 
        1700 to 64,000 in 1801. Another legacy of Bristol&#8217;s involvement 
        in the Slave Trade was a small but significant Black population. </p>
      <h4>Was Woodes Rogers&#8217;s voyage from 1708 to 1711 a slaving voyage? 
      </h4>
      <p>In the strict sense of the word, it was not. The intention of the voyage 
        was to harass the enemies of Britain, namely the French and Spanish, who 
        had been fighting them in the War of Spanish Succession since 1702. Harassment 
        meant the plunder of as many ships as possible on the high seas. Sometimes, 
        as the raid at Guayaquil shows, it also included pillaging towns to gain 
        &#8216;prizes&#8217;. This booty and any other captured &#8216;prizes&#8217; 
        were then sold on return to England and any captured ships condemned. 
        The Admiralty gave permission for these voyages through the issue of letters 
        of marque and reprisal, which were issued at the highest level by the 
        Lord High Admiral. At the time of the Woodes Rogers voyage, the Lord High 
        Admiral was Prince George of Denmark, Queen Anne&#8217;s husband. Money 
        from the voyage was also made by HM Customs on the return of the ships.</p>
      <p>On the other side, the merchant backers of these voyages, after payment 
        of the crews and other associated costs, stood to make a huge profit from 
        a successful privateering voyage. Thomas Goldney II, the principal backer 
        of the voyage of Woodes Rogers, had invested in 36 shares at &pound;3,726. 
        His returns were &pound;6,826 1s, a huge profit for its day, although 
        at the time he believed there was more profit to be made.</p>

      <p>There is another side to the voyage, however, that is often obscured 
        by the other dramatic events: the fact that a large amount of &#8216;Negro&#8217; 
        slaves had been captured by the privateers on Woodes Rogers&#8217; voyage 
        and other privateering ventures. Rogers&#8217;s account of his voyage 
        in,<em> A Cruising Voyage round the World, first to the South Seas, thence 
        to the East Indies, and homeward by the Cape of Good Hope. Begun in 1708 
        and finish&#8217;d in 1711</em>, published in 1712, is full of references 
        to &#8216;Negroes&#8217;. When the <em>Ascension</em> was captured on 
        the 2 April 1709, there were 72 &#8216;Negroes&#8217; on board.</p>

      <p>Account books with recordings of all the transactions have been preserved 
        in the Chancery Masters&#8217; exhibits at The National Archives. These 
        records were kept as part of the owners&#8217; agreements and later used 
        in the court case brought against Woodes Rogers, known as Creagh v Rogers. 
        The records and accounts clearly show that &#8216;Negro&#8217; slaves 
        were sold as the voyage progressed whilst others given away to local dignitaries 
        as gifts as well as to crew as prizes. In the committee books of the <em>Duke</em> 
        and <em>Dutchess</em>, there is an entry dated 29 August 1709; &#8216;In 
        consideration of the great risqu&eacute; that Captain Edward Cooke and 
        Captain Robert Frye ran in attacking the Marquis when in the hands of 
        the Spaniards we do in behalf of the owners agree to give Captain Cooke 
        the Black boy Dublin and Captain Frye the Black boy Emauel of Martineco 
        as a free gift.&#8217; Rogers&#8217; journal reveals that a number of 
        these slaves ran away, others died on the voyage while some were even 
        used as makeshift marines when the ships were in danger of being attacked.</p>
      <p>It is clear from both Woodes Rogers&#8217; accounts and the Chancery 
        Masters exhibits that slaves were captured and sold in large numbers on 
        the voyage. The profits that were made from this voyage, therefore, were 
        due in part to slave trading even though this may not have been the intention 
        of the owners or crew at the outset. Most intriguing of all is the question 
        of whether any of these slaves arrived back in Britain. What happened, 
        for example, to Dublin and Emauel? Here, the records are less clear; however, 
        in one of the papers relating to accounts there is mention of sundry payments 
        to a John Ivey &#8216;for keeping Negroes&#8217;. Was this in England? 
        In the same set of accounts is one dated 1 April 1713, which mentions 
        &#8216;Money oweing for several Negroes sold in England&#8217;.</p>

        Most intriguing of all are two entries in the exhibits under the heading 
        &#8216;Additional shares not settled in August last&#8217;. The first, 
        dated 7 August 1713, has an entry for &#8216;Pero the Black, half a share&#8217; 
        while the second, dated 23 July </p>
      <p>1714, reveals &#8216;John Walker a Negro made his claim which was afterwards 
        allowed 3 November 1714&#8217;.</p>

      <p>Here is evidence which suggests that slaves who had come to Britain as
