      <h4>Alexander Selkirk and the voyage of the <em>Cinque Ports</em> Galley</h4>

        Crusoe is a fictional character in a book written by Daniel Defoe, first 
        published in 1719. In this famous book, Robinson Crusoe is shipwrecked 
        and marooned on an island surviving alone until he meets up with Man Friday, 
        another inhabitant of the island.</p>
      <p>The story by Defoe, however, was based on the real life experiences of 
        a Scottish seaman called Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk was born in 1676 in 
        Lower Largo, Fife. He was taken on as master of the <em>Cinque Ports</em>, 
        a galley which was commissioned for a privateering voyage in 1702. The 
        owners obtained a letter of marque and reprisal from the Lord High Admiral. 
        These letters enabled merchant ships to be armed for self-defence from 
        foreign ships but also sanctioned attacks on foreign ships, especially 
        those deemed enemies of Britain. In reality, privateering was little more 
        than high seas piracy and the booty collected was another way of making 
        money when &#8216;normal&#8217; maritime trade was suspended, such as 
        in time of war.</p>

      <p>In April 1703, Dampier left London in charge of two ships, the other 
        being the <em>Fame</em> with Captain Pulling in charge. However, even 
        before the two ships had left the Downs, the two captains argued and the 
        <em>Fame </em>sailed off, leaving the <em>St George</em> on her own. Captain 
        Dampier sailed into Kinsale, Ireland and there met up with the <em>Cinque 
        Ports</em> under the command of Captain Pickering. The two ships decided 
        to join forces and a new agreement of dubious legality was made between 
        the two captains. </p>
      <p>Captain Dampier had been engaged by Thomas Escourt to sail two ships 
        to the South Sea (Pacific Ocean) where they would seek out Spanish treasure 
        ships, plunder them and return to England with the booty to sell for a 
        profit. The two captains proposed to sail down the coast of South America 
        and capture a Spanish treasure ship at Buenos Aires. If the booty from 
        this capture amounted to &pound;60,000 or above, the boats would immediately 
        return to England. If they missed the ship, however, they would plan to 
        sail around Cape Horn to capture Spanish vessels carrying gold to the 
        mines at Lima. Failing that, the ships would sail north and attempt to 
        capture the Acapulco &#8211; Manila ship, which was nearly always laden 
        with treasure.</p>
      <p>The ships left Ireland in May 1703 and as the voyage progressed, things 
        began to go wrong. There were many arguments between the captains and 
        crew and then Captain Pickering of the <em>Cinque Ports</em> was taken 
        ill and died. His second-in-command, Thomas Stradling, replaced him. The 
        arguments, however, continued. The root of the discontent was the crew&#8217;s 
        feeling that Captain Dampier was not ruthless enough in taking opportunities 
        to plunder passing ships and as a consequence, large amounts of booty 
        were being lost. There was also a feeling that, where booty was taken, 
        Captain Dampier and his friend Edward Morgan were taking the prizes for 
        personal gain.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="voyage.htm#selkirk">back to main page </a></p>
      <p>Matters came to head in February, 1704 when the crew of the <em>Cinque 
        Ports</em> mutinied during a stop at the island of Juan Fernandez and 
        refused to get back on board the ship. The crew only returned to the ship 
        after the intervention of Captain Dampier. To make matters worse, the 
        ship left its sails and gear behind on the island after spotting a French 
        ship. As the voyage progressed, opportunities to clean and repair the 
        ships in order to prevent worm damage were lost and two ships soon began 
        to leak. By now relations between the two ships had reached the point 
        where they both agreed that on reaching the Bay of Panama, they should 
        divide the spoils and go their separate ways. </p>
      <p><img src="images/atlas.jpg" alt="Map of the island of Juan Fernandez" width="149" height="216" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="left" class="frame">In 
        September 1704, the St.George sailed off and the <em>Cinque Ports</em> 
        returned to Juan Fernandez in an attempt to recover her sails and gear 
        only to find that the French ship had removed them. It was here that Alexander 
        Selkirk, the master of the <em>Cinque Ports</em>, carried out a personal 
        rebellion by refusing to sail on the ship. He felt that the state of the 
        ship was so bad and his relations with Captain Stradling so strained that 
        he would rather take his chances marooned on Mas a Tierra, one of the 
        uninhabited islands of the Juan Fernandez group. He was left with a gun, 
        a knife, a hatchet, some oats and tobacco, as well as a bible, books of 
        devotion and some navigational instruments. At the last moment, Selkirk 
        asked to be taken back on board but Captain Stradling refused to take 
        him back. In the end, Selkirk&#8217;s decision, albeit reluctantly, turned 
        out to be a wise one. The <em>Cinque Ports</em> leaked so heavily after 
        leaving Juan Fernandez that the crew had to abandon ship and take to rafts. 
        Only 18 sailors survived to reach the South American mainland where they 
        were captured, mistreated by both the Spanish and the native people and 
        imprisoned.</p>
      <p><img src="images/crusoeboat2.jpg" alt="Robinson Crusoe builds a boat" width="150" height="265" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="right" class="frame">Selkirk 
        remained alone on the island for four years and four months. He was rescued 
        by another privateering voyage led by Captain Woodes Rogers. In his journal 
        of this famous voyage from 1708 to 1711, Rogers described the moment when 
        Selkirk was rescued in February 1709:</p>
      <p>&#8216;We arrived at the island of Juan Fernandez on 31 January. We lay 
        there to recoup ourselves until 13 February. At the island we found one 
        Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman who was left there by Captain Stradling, 
        Captain Dampier&#8217;s consort the last voyage and survived four years 
        and four months without conversing with any creature, having no company 
        but wild goats&#8230;&#8217;</p>
      <p>In fact, Alexander Selkirk, despite his enforced solitude, had to be 
        persuaded to come on board after finding out that amongst his rescuers 
        was William Dampier, the commodore of the ill-fated voyage of the <em>Cinque 
        Ports</em> and now the pilot of Woodes Rogers&#8217; voyage. Eventually, 
        Selkirk was persuaded to join the voyage and on Dampier&#8217;s recommendation 
        he was made mate aboard Rogers&#8217; ship, the Duke. The following year, 
        after the capture of the Spanish treasure ship, the<em> Nuestra Senora 
        de la Incarnacion Disenganio</em>, Selkirk was promoted to sail master 
        on the ship which had been renamed the Batchelor. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Woodes Rogers&#8217;s voyage ended in 1711 with their arrival in the 
        Thames. Both Rogers and Selkirk achieved fame on their return. Selkirk, 
        however, was asked to give evidence in a court case brought against William 
        Dampier by Elizabeth Creswell, the daughter of the owner of the first 
        voyage, for the losses incurred in the 1703 venture.</p>
