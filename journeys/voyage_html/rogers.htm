      <p>Woodes Rogers, a sea captain, sailed from Bristol in August 1708 and 
        arrived back in the Thames at Erith in October 1711. His voyage had been 
        an extraordinary journey in which Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, 
        becoming only the third Englishman to have succeeded at that time. Outside 
        the house where Woodes Rogers lived, in the fashionable Queen Square in 
        Bristol, there is a plaque which states simply: 'Woodes Rogers 1679 - 
        1732 Great Seaman, Circumnavigator, Colonial Governor Lived in a house 
        on this site'. As is often the case with monuments, there is far more 
        history to be found behind the few words on the plaque. Woodes Rogers 
        was indeed a great seaman but the voyage for which he became famous was 
        a privateering voyage, his notoriety stemming from acts of high seas piracy 
        as well as his skill as a seaman.</p>
      <p>A group of Bristol businessmen were backers of the voyage. To raise money 
        for the ships, 256 shares at &pound;103 10s were issued. These shares 
        were taken up by a relatively small group of merchants including many 
        prominent Bristolians such as mayors, ex-mayors, sheriffs, aldermen, town 
        clerks and physicians. The person who bought the most shares and so, therefore, 
        the principal investor in the voyage was Thomas Goldney II, the Bristol 
        grocer who had bought 36 shares. </p>

      <p>Rogers was to be commodore of the voyage but to avoid the sort of trouble 
        encountered on Dampier&#8217;s voyage a council with a constitution under 
        the presidency of Thomas Dover was set up to make the decisions. The two 
        ships set off in August 1708 and by September they had encountered their 
        first foreign ship. Rogers&#8217; refusal to search the ship thoroughly 
        led to a mutiny, which was ruthlessly suppressed. Through the winter of 
        1708 to 1709, the ships made their way down the east coast of South America 
        and round Cape Horn.</p>

      <p>It was off the coast of Chile, in February 1709, that the ships rescued 
        Alexander Selkirk at Juan Fernandez. The period from February to December 
        1709 was an active and lucrative phase in their privateering activities. 
        Twenty ships were captured and plundered including the <em>Assumption</em>, 
        the <em>Santa Josepha</em>, the <em>Ascension</em>, the <em>Joseph</em> 
        and the <em>Havre de Grace</em>. In April 1709, the town of Guayaquil 
        in Ecuador was raided. </p>

      <p>The<em> Havre de Grace</em>, now renamed the <em>Marquis</em>, and the<em> 
        Joseph</em> were converted into privateers. The high point of the voyage 
        for the crew was the capture of one of the Spanish treasure ships, the 
        <em>Nuestra Senora de la Incarnacion Disenganio</em>, later renamed the 
        <em>Batchelor</em>. The capture was tempered, however, with the privateers&#8217; 
        failure to seize the second treasure ship, the <em>Bigonia</em>, suffering 
        much damage and loss of life in the attempt. </p>
      <p>In January 1710, after despatching prisoners to Acapulco, the ships began 
        their long voyage home across the South Seas via Guam, Batavia and the 
        Cape of Good Hope. In July 1711, the <em>Duke</em>, the <em>Dutchess</em> 
        and the <em>Batchelor</em> arrived in Tetzel in Holland before sailing 
        to England, which they reached in October 1711.</p>
      <p>As befitted such a dramatic voyage, the end was also steeped in controversy. 
        The East India Company, determined to ensure the continuation of their 
        monopoly of the South Seas, accused the privateers of trading in Batavia. 
        To that end, they had sent their agents to seize the ships once they docked 
        in London. They succeeded in seizing the <em>Batchelor</em>. The owners, 
        having petitioned the Attorney General to no avail, met the governors 
        of the East India Company. They agreed on a payment of &pound;6,000 to 
        the East India Company to settle the matter, a sum which included a bribe 
        of &pound;161 5s to an unnamed member of the Company. This payment angered 
        the principal shareholder of the voyage, Thomas Goldney II, who believed 
        the money and other miscellaneous expenses &#8216;weakly parted with&#8217;. 
        The sale of goods from the voyage began in 1711 and did not conclude until 
        1713.</p>
      <p>In 1712, Woodes Rogers was brought to court by Stephen Creagh, an agent 
        of the sailors, on a charge of &#8216;fraud against the owners&#8217;. 
        The dispute cost him dearly and he was bankrupted in the process despite 
        his achievements. Rogers sailed to the Bahamas in 1718 where he was appointed 
        the governor. He died in the Bahamas in 1732.<br>
