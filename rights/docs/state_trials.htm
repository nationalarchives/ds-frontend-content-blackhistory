          <td><p>According to Lord Mansfield, the presiding judge in the Somerset 
              case, the question that the Court had to answer was &#8216;&#8230;Whether 
              any dominion, authority or coercion can be exercised in this country, 
              on a slave according to the American laws?&#8217; In his decision 
              on 22 June 1772, in effect preventing the forced return of James 
              Somerset to the West Indies to be resold, Lord Mansfield stated: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>&#8216;The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it 
                is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, 
                but only by positive law,&#8230;It is so odious, that nothing 
                can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, 
                therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case 
                is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the 
                black must be discharged.&#8217; </em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The implications of the judgement in the Somerset case were far-reaching, 
              but were not what many slaves believed them to be. It did not emancipate 
              them, or free them to work for any employer once in Britain. What 
              it did do was remove the element of compulsion by providing slaves 
              with the legal right not to be forcibly removed from the country.
