          <td>These extracts are taken from the speech William Davidson made to 
            the court before sentence was passed. In it, he passionately affirms 
            the right of the individual to bear arms against a repressive state 
            and invokes Magna Carta as the justification for this. The Peterloo 
            Massacre of the previous year, in which local yeomanry attacked a 
            political meeting in Manchester killing 11, had politicised many, 
            including Davidson; and many radicals now believed they had to arm 
            themselves for protection from the government. In the circumstances, 
            Davidson claims, the acts of the conspirators were not treasonable. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Both during the trial and in his final speech to the Court, Davidson 
            continued to deny any involvement in the conspiracy, and some of the 
            evidence would appear to be questionable. Many of the witnesses gave 
            evidence about a Black man or a 'man of colour' - but they did so 
            without actually identifying Davidson as that man.<br>
