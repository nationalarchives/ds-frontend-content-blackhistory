                  themselves together in a Riotous and Tumultuous Manner, and 
                  have been guilty of many Acts of Treason and Rebellion, having 
                  made an Assault on the Gaol of <em>Newgate</em>, set loose the 
                  Prisoners confined therein, and set fire to and destroyed the 
                  said Prison: And whereas Houses are now pulling down in several 
                  Parts of Our Cities of <em>London</em> and <em>Westminster</em>, 
                  and Liberties thereof, and Fires kindled for consuming the Materials 
                  and Furniture of the same, whereby it is become absolutely necessary 
                  to use the most effectual Means to quiet such Disturbances, 
                  to preserve the Lives and Properties of Individuals, and to 
                  restore the Peace of the Country: We therefore, taking the same 
                  into Our most serious Consideration, have thought fit, by and 
                  with the Advice of Our Privy Council, to issue this Our Royal 
                  Proclamation, hereby strictly charging and exhorting all Our 
                  loving Subjects to preserve the Peace, and to keep themselves, 
                  their Servants and Apprentices, quietly within their respective 
                  Dwellings, to the End that all well-disposed Persons may avoid 
                  those Mischiefs which the Continuance of such riotous Proceedings 
                  may bring upon the Guilty: And as it is necessary, from the 
                  circumstances before-mentioned, to employ the Military Force, 
                  with which We are by Law entrusted for the immediate Suppression 
                  of such Rebellious and Traiterous Attempts, now making against 
                  the Peace and Dignity of Our Crown, and the Safety of the Lives 
                  and Properties of Our Subjects, We have therefore issued the 
                  most direct and effectual Orders to all Our Officers, by an 
                  immediate Exertion of their utmost Force, to repress the same,
