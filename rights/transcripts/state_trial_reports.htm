                  Soho, on the evening of 18th Aug. last, at eight o'clock, to 
                  a back room on the third floor - I there found Cuffey, and took

                  the room - I saw him go to a drawer, fumble about, and apparently 
                  take something out - I went and caught hold of his hand - we 
                  had a scuffle, and in the scuffle he tried to pass this pistol 
                  to his wife - it fell on the ground - he said it was loaded

                  meet at twenty minutes past nine, and to bring what arms they 
                  could get - a motion was made as to where the localities should 
                  meet on the Wednesday - one was appointed to meet, at the Peacock, 
                  Westminster-road; another, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, 
                  Cripplegate; another, at Breadon's beer-shop, Shouldham-street; 
                  and the fourth, I think, at the Buck's Head, somewhere about 
                  Bethnal-green-road, or Hackney-road - a motion had been made 
                  the night before that the delegates should select four men that 
                  were willing to risk anything and everything to attend where 
                  Ritchie should appoint them; it was merely a conversation - 
                  they were appointed to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree, from 
                  five to seven - they were called <em>luminaries </em>by Mullins 
                  - there was to be a pass-word-Ritchie was to say to them, when 
                  they came in, &quot;Do you want me?&quot; and if they answered 
                  &quot;Justice&quot; he would know they were the men sent by 
                  the delegates - nothing was said about what Ritchie was to provide, 
                  but that he would give instructions to these men; but each man 
                  was advised to come armed, if he could - we met at the Orange 
                  Tree, Red Lion-square on the 14th - there were between twenty 
                  and thirty present - Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Cuffey, Ritchie, 
                  Crookshank, Alnutt, Fay, Johnson, Pearce, Simmons, Fleming, 
                  two Granshaws, (brothers,) and a person named Ford; he was not 
                  a delegate, but was bail for Ernest Jones, he brought 6<em>s. 
                  </em>1<em>d</em>. from a new locality started at Knightsbridge 
                  - I do not know where he lived; I understood that he came from 
                  Knighsbridge-district - at the same time he came, Mr. Reardon, 
                  the editor of the <em>Northern Star, </em>came under the pretence 
                  that he was sent to the meeting; but there had been reports 
                  that he was a Government spy, and they would not go on with 
                  the business till he left the room - he was asked to go down 
                  stairs - it was moved by Mullins, at that meeting, that each 
                  delegate should go back to his locality and pick four men out, 
                  who were willing to do anything that was required of them - 
                  some one asked what they meant by it, and he said he would point 
                  to the gas, and they might take by his pointing what he meant; 
                  and Cuffey said it was no use to mince the matter, they wanted 
                  them for firing, or anything that might be required of them; 
                  for it was no use to mince the matter now, they knew their necks 
                  were in jeopardy; in fact, the halter was round their necks, 
                  and it was no use to say it in half words; that they wanted 
                  men to fire station-houses, or warehouses, or anything that 
                  might be required of them - a motion was made that two delegates 
                  should be sent to the meeting of the engine-drivers of the North 
                  Western Railway to know what their opinions were; not to compromise 
                  themselves too much, by stating their views, and getting them 
                  to join the Chartists, but to hear the opinions of the drivers 
                  first; and if they found they were agreeable to close with the 
                  Chartists, they were to bring them to the meeting, or delegates 
                  from their body, on a future nigh - Crookshank and Ritchie were 
                  appointed to go, and 18<em>d</em>. was allowed them for expenses 
                  - a remark was made that they wondered Lacey had not come that 
                  night - they waited for him till half-past eight, and then adjourned 
                  to the Lord Denman - there was another meeting that night of 
                  Confederates, at Nagle's; I did not attend it - Johnson attended 
                  both these meetings - I did not, at that time, know that his 
                  name was other than Johnson - I did not know he was in communication 
                  with the police; in fact, he was the last man I should have 
                  thought of - I have not had any communication with him since, 
                  except one word as I stood in Court, now - the meeting before 
                  that at the Orange Tree was held, I think, at Breadon's - I 
                  remember two or three meetings at Hopkinson's...</td>
