                            <br>
                            On the 3d of December 1771, affidavits were made by 
                            Thomas Walklin, Elizabeth Cade, and John Marlow, that 
                            James Sommersett, a negro, was confined in irons on 
                            board a ship called the Ann and Mary, John Knowles 
                            commander, lying in the Thames, and bound for Jamaica; 
                            and lord Mansfield, on an application supported by 
                            these affidavits, allowed a write of Habeas Corpus, 
                            directed to Mr. Knowles, and requiring him to return 
                            the body of Sommersett before his lordship, with the 
                            cause of detainer.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Knowles on the 9th 
                            of December produced the body of Sommersett before 
                            lord Mansfield, and returned for cause of detainer, 
                            that Sommersett was the negro slave of Charles Steuart, 
                            esq. who had delivered Sommersett into Mr. Knowles's 
                            custody, in order to carry him to Jamaica, and there 
                            sell him as a slave. Affidavits were also made by 
                            Mr. Steuart and two other gentlemen, to prove that 
                            Mr. Steuart had purchased Sommersett as a slave in 
                            Virginia, and had afterwards brought him into England, 
                            where he left his master's service; and that his refusing 
                            to return, was the occasion of his being carried on 
                            board Mr. Knowle's ship.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord <em>Mansfield </em>chusing 
                            to refer the matter to the determination of the court 
                            of King's-bench, Sommersett with sureties was bound 
                            in a recognizance for his appearance there on the 
                            second day of the next Hilary term; and his lordship 
                            allowed till that day for settling the form of the 
                            return to the Habeas Corpus. Accordingly on that day 
                            Sommersett appeared in the court of King's-bench, 
                            and then the following return was read:...</p></td>

                          important matters which this case involved, viz. first, 
                          The rights over the person of a negro resident here, 
                          claimed by another person as the owner of the negro; 
                          and, supposing such rights to exist, secondly, The extent 
                          of them; and thirdly, The means of inforcing them, were, 
                          I believe, never, except in this case, made the subject 
                          of a suit at law in England. But in Scotland two cases 
                          of this sort have occurred before the Court of Session; 
                          1, That of Sheddan against Sheddan, A.D. 1756; 2, That 
                          of Knight against Wedderburn, A.D. 1775-1778.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 
                          these two cases the following reports are printed from 
                          the 'Dictionary of Decisions,' tit. 'Slave,' vol. 33,

                          who had been bought in Virginia, and brought to Britain 
                          to be taught a trade, and who had been baptized in Britain, 
                          having claimed his liberty, against his master Robert 
                          Sheddan, who had put him on board a ship, to carry him 
                          back to Virginia, the Lords appointed counsel for the 
                          negro, and ordered memorials, and afterwards a hearing 
                          in presence, upon the respective claims of liberty and 
                          servitude by the master and the negro.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But, 
                          during the hearing in presence, the negro died; so the 
                          point was not determined.&quot;<br> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL.

                          Wedderburn. - <em>January </em>15, 1778.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          commander of a vessel, in the African trade, having 
                          imported a cargo of negroes into Jamaica, sold Joseph 
                          Knight, one of them, as a slave, to Mr. Wedderburn. 
                          Knight was then a boy, seemingly about twelve or thirteen 
                          years of age.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some 
                          time after, Mr. Wedderburn came over to Scotland, and 
                          brought this negro along with him, as a personal servant.<br> 
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The negro continued 
                          to serve him for several years, without murmuring, and 
                          married in the country. But, afterwards, prompted to 
                          assert his freedom, he took the resolution of leaving 
                          Mr. Wedderburn's service, who, being informed of it, 
                          got him apprehended, on a warrant of the justices of 
                          peace. Knight, on his examination, acknowledged his 
                          purpose. The justices found 'the petitioner entitled 
                          to Knight's services, and that he must continue as before.'<br> 
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knight then applied 
                          to the sheriff of the county, (Perthshire), by petition, 
                          setting forth, 'That Mr. Wedderburn insisted on his 
                          continuing a personal servant with him,' and prayed 
                          the sheriff to find, 'That he cannot be continued in 
                          a state of slavery, or compelled to perpetual service; 
                          and to discharge Mr. Wedderburn from sending the petitioner 
                          abroad.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After 
                          some procedure in this process, the sheriff found, 'That 
                          the state of slavery is not recognized by the laws of 
                          this kingdom, and is inconsistent with the principles 
                          thereof; that the regulations in Jamaica, concerning 
                          slaves, do not extend to this kingdom; and repelled 
                          the defender's claim to a perpetual service.' Mr. Wedderburn 
                          having reclaimed, the sheriff found, 'That without wages, 
                          is slavery; and therefore adhered.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          defender removed the cause into the court by advocation. 
                          The lord ordinary took it to report upon informations. 
                          Being a question of general importance, the Court ordered 
                          a hearing in presence, and afterwards informations of 
                          new, upon which it was advised.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<em>Pleaded 
                          for the Master</em>: That he had a right either to the 
                          perpetual service of the negro in this country, or to 
                          send him back to the plantations from which he was brought. 
                          His claim over the negro, to this extent, was argued 
                          on the following grounds:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          productions of the colonies, ever since they were settled, 
                          have been cultivated by the means of negro slaves imported 
                          from the coast of Africa. The supplying the colonies 
                          with these slaves has become an extensive trade; without 
                          which, the valuable objects of commerce, now furnished 
                          by the plantations, could not be cultivated. British 
                          statutes have given sanction to this trade, and recognized 
                          the property of the master in such slaves; 10th W. 3, 
                          c, 26; 5th Geo. 2, c. 7; 23d Geo. 2, c. 3.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          property which, in Jamaica, was established in the master 
                          over the negro, under these statutes, and the municipal 
                          law there, cannot be lost by a mere change of place. 
                          On principles of equity, rights acquired under the laws 
                          of foreign countries are supported and inforced by the 
                          courts of law here. A right of property will be sustained 
                          in every country where the subject of it may come. The 
                          <em>status</em> of persons attend them wherever they 
                          go; Huber, lib. 1, t. 3, c. 12.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          law of the colonies is not to be considered as unjust, 
                          in authorizing this condition of slavery. The statutes 
                          which encourage the African trade show, that the legislature 
                          does not look on it in that light. The state of slavery 
                          is not contrary to the law of nations. Writers upon 
                          that law have enumerated several just and lawful origins 
                          of slavery; such as contract, conquest in a just war, 
                          and punishment of crimes. In cases where slavery is 
                          authorized by the laws of Jamaica, it must be presumed 
                          to have proceeded on a lawful origin. The municipal 
                          law of no country will be presumed unjust.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A 
                          state of slavery has been universally received in the 
                          practice of nations. It took place in all the ancient 
                          nations, and in all the modern European nations, for 
                          many ages. In some of them it still remains; and in 
                          none of them has it been abolished by positive enactments, 
                          declaring it unjust and illegal, but gone into disuse 
                          by degrees, in consequence of many different causes. 
                          Though, therefore, the municipal law of this country 
                          does not now admit of this state of slavery in the persons 
                          of citizens, yet, where foreigners, in that state, are 
                          brought into the country, the right of their masters 
                          over them ought not to be annihilated.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In 
                          this case, the master is not insisting for the exercise 
                          of any rigorous powers. He only demands, that he shall 
                          be intitled to the personal services of the negro, in 
                          this country, during his life. His right to this extent, 
                          at least, is not immoral or unjust; nor is it even reprobated 
                          by the municipal law of this country. A person may bind 
                          himself to a service for life; Ersk. Inst. b. 1, t. 
                          7, &sect; 62.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But, 
                          in this last place, if this is denied, the master must, 
                          at last, be permitted to compel the negro to return 
                          to the plantations, from whence he was brought; otherwise 
                          he is intirely forfeited of his right.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some 
                          cases from the English law-books were adduced to show, 
                          that, in England, the master's right of property in 
                          his negro remains after he is brought into that country;

                          his master, to Great Britain or Ireland, doth not become 
                          free; and that his master's property or right in him 
                          is not thereby determined or varied; and baptism doth 
                          not bestow freedom on him, nor make any alteration in 
                          his temporal condition in these kingdoms. We are also 
                          of opinion, that the master may legally compel him to 
                          return to the plantations.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<em>Answered 
                          for the Negro</em>: The only title on which any right 
                          of dominion is claimed over this African, is the institution 
                          of the municipal law of Jamaica, which authorizes the 
                          slavery of Africans brought into that island. Under 
                          that law, this negro, a child when brought into Jamaica, 
                          while he remained there, was subjected to the unjust 
                          dominion which it gives over these foreigners; but the 
                          municipal law of the colonies has no authority in this 
                          country. On grounds of equity, the Court, in some cases, 
                          gives effect to the laws of other countries; but the 
                          law of Jamaica, in this instance, will not be supported 
                          by the Court; because it is repugnant to the first principles 
                          of morality and justice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Subordination, 
                          to a certain extent, is necessary; but there are certain 
                          bounds, beyond which, if any institution, subjecting 
                          one individual to another, should go, the injustice 
                          and immorality of it cannot admit of a doubt. Such is 
                          the institution of slavery, depriving men of the most 
                          essential rights that attend their existence, and which 
                          are of a nature that admit not of any equivalent to 
                          be given for them. The most express consent, given in 
                          a voluntary contract, cannot authorize the assuming 
                          of these rights, or bind the consenting party to submit 
                          to the condition of a slave. A stipulation of that kind 
                          affords intrinsic evidence of an undue advantage taken, 
                          and is therefore sufficient to void the contract.<br> 
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But, although it 
                          were justifiable to admit of a slavery proceeding on 
                          a title of contract, of conquest, or of punishment, 
                          the law of Jamaica would not be the less unjust. In 
                          subjecting the Africans to slavery, that law requires 
                          no title under any of these grounds. The circumstances, 
                          that the negroes are brought into Jamaica, is all that 
                          is requisite to fix on them indiscriminately the condition 
                          of slavery. It is, therefore, a slavery established 
                          on force and usurpation alone, which no writer on the 
                          law of nations has vindicated as a justifiable origin 
                          of slavery.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If 
                          the law of Jamaica had made any distinction, or required 
                          any title to the slavery of an African, this negro would 
                          never have been reduced by it to that state. Being a 
                          child when he was brought into Jamaica, he could enter 
                          into no contract, commit no crime, and conquest cannot 
                          give a right to kill or enslave children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          means by which those who carried this child from his 
                          own country got him into their hands, cannot be known; 
                          because the law of Jamaica makes no inquiry into that 
                          circumstance. But, whether he was ensnared, or bought 
                          from his parents, the iniquity is the same. - That a 
                          state of slavery has been admitted of in many nations, 
                          does not render it less unjust. Child-murder, and other 
                          crimes of a deep dye, have been authorised by the laws 
                          of different states. Tyranny, and all sorts of oppression, 
                          might be vindicated on the same grounds. - Neither can 
                          the advantages procured to this country, by the slavery 
                          of the negroes, be hearkened to, as any argument in 
                          this question, as to the justice of it. Oppression and 
                          iniquity are not palliated by the gain and advantage 
                          acquired to the authors of them. But the expediency 
                          of the institution, even for the subjects of Great Britain, 
                          is much doubted of by those who are best acquainted 
                          with the state of the colonies; and some enlightened 
                          men of modern times have thought, that sugar and tobacco 
                          might be cultivated without the slavery of negroes. 
                          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The dominion, 
                          therefore, given by the law of Jamaica over the pursuer, 
                          a foreigner there, being unjust, can receive no aid 
                          from the laws of this country. The modification proposed 
                          of this claim of slavery, makes no difference on the 
                          merits of the question. It is plain, that, to give the 
                          defender any right over the pursuer, the positive law 
                          of Jamaica must always be resorted to; consequently, 
                          the question recurs, Whether that law ought to be enforced 
                          beyond its territory? But a service for life, without 
                          wages, is, in fact, slavery. The law of Scotland would 
                          not support a voluntary contract in these terms; and, 
                          even where wages are stipulated, such a contract has 
                          been voided by the Court; Allan and Mearns <em>contra 
                          </em>Skene and Burnet, No. 5, p. 9454, <em>voce </em>Pactum 
                          Illicitum. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          answer was given to the other claim, of sending the 
                          negro out of this country, without his consent, that 
                          it supposes the dominion given over the pursuer by the 
                          law of Jamaica to be just. The negro is likewise protected 
                          against this by the statute 1701, c. 6, which expressly 
                          prohibits the carrying any persons out of the kingdom 
                          without their consent. The words are general, and apply 
                          to all persons within the realm.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In 
                          support of this argument for the negro, authorities 
                          of French writers were adduced, to show, that formerly, 
                          by the laws of France, negroes brought into that country 
                          from the plantations became free. This was their law, 
                          until lately, that, by special edicts, some alterations 
                          were made upon it; Denisart, tom. 3, <em>v</em>. Negro. 
                          On the law of England, several cases were mentioned, 
                          in which different judges had expressed opinions, that 
                          a negro coming into England is free there; 1 Salk. 666,

                          Nalvey, in Chancery 1762; Hargrave's Arg. p. 58.<br> 
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But the late case 
                          of Sommersett, the negro, decided in the King's-bench, 
                          in the year 1772, was chiefly relied on, and said to 
                          be in point; at least upon this question, Whether the 
                          negro could be sent out of England?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The 
                          <em>Court</em> were of opinion, that the dominion assumed 
                          over this negro, under the law of Jamaica, being unjust, 
                          could not be supported in this country to any extent: 
                          that, therefore, the defender had no right to the negro's 
                          service for any space of time, nor to send him out of 
                          the country against his consent: that the negro was

                    gradually purifying ever since the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. 
                    Dunning seems to have discovered so much, as he finds it changes 
                    a slave into a servant; though unhappily he does not think 
                    it of efficacy enough to prevent that pestilent disease reviving,

                    and legally it seems we ought to say,) this happy country. 
                    However, it has been asserted, and is now repeated by me, 
                    this air is too pure for a slave to breathe in: I trust, I 
                    shall not quit this court without certain conviction of the 
                    truth of that assertion.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord <em>Mansfield</em>. - 
                    The question is, if the owner had a right to detain the slave, 
                    for the sending of him over to be sold in Jamaica. In five 
                    or six cases of this nature, I have known it to be accommodated 
                    by agreement between the parties: on its first coming before 
                    me, I strongly recommended it here. But if the parties will 
                    have it decided, we must give our opinion. Compassion will 
                    not, on the one hand, nor inconvenience on the other, be to 
                    decide; but the law: in which the difficulty will be principally 
                    from the inconvenience on both sides. Contract for sale of 
                    a slave is good here; the sale is a matter to which the law 
                    properly and readily attaches, and will maintain the price 
                    according to the agreement. But here the person of the slave 
                    himself is immediately the object of enquiry; which makes 
                    a very material difference. The now question is, Whether any 
                    dominion, authority or coercion can be exercised in this country, 
                    on a slave according to the American laws? The difficulty 
                    of adopting the relation, without adopting it in all its consequences, 
                    is indeed extreme; and yet, many of those consequences are 
                    absolutely contrary to the municipal law of England. We have 
                    no authority to regulate the conditions in which law shall 
                    operate. On the other hand, should we think the coercive power 
                    cannot be exercised: it is now about 50 years since the opinion 
                    given by two of the greatest men of their own or any times, 
                    (since which no contract has been brought to trial, between 
                    the masters and slaves;) the service performed by the slaves 
                    without wages, is a clear indication they did not think themselves 
                    free by coming hither. The setting 14,000 or 15,000 men at 
                    once loose by a solemn opinion, is very disagreeable in the 
                    effects it threatens. There is a case in Hobart, (Coventry 
                    and Woodfall,) where a man had contracted to go as a mariner: 
                    but the now case will not come within that decision. Mr. Steuart 
                    advances no claims on contract; he rests his whole demand 
                    on a right to the negro as slave, and mentions the purpose 
                    of detainure to be the sending of him over to be sold in Jamaica. 
                    If the parties will have judgment, 'fiat justitia, ruat coelum;' 
                    let justice be done whatever be the consequence.<em> 50l</em>. 
                    a-head may not be a high price; then a loss follows to the 
                    proprietors of above 700,000<em>l</em>. sterling. How would 
                    the law stand with respect to their settlement; their wages? 
                    How many actions for any slight coercion by the master? We 
                    cannot in any of these points direct the law; the law must 
                    rule us. In these particulars, it may be matter of weighty 
                    consideration, what provisions are made or set by law. Mr. 
                    Steuart may end the question, by discharging or giving freedom 
                    to the negro. I did think at first to put the matter to a 
                    more solemn way of argument: but if my brothers agree, there 
                    seems no occasion. I do not imagine, after the point has been 
                    discussed on both sides so extremely well, any new light could 
                    be thrown on the subject. If the parties chuse to refer it 
                    to the Common Pleas, they can give themselves that satisfaction 
                    whenever they think fit. An application to parliament, if 
                    the merchants think the question of great commercial concern, 
                    is the best, and perhaps the only method of settling the point 
                    for the future. The Court is greatly obliged to the gentlemen 
                    of the bar who have spoke on the subject; and by whose care 
                    and abilities so much has been effected, that the rule of 
                    decision will be reduced to a very easy compass. I cannot 
                    omit to express particular happiness in seeing young men, 
                    just called to the bar, have been able so much to profit by 
                    their reading. I think it is right the matter should stand 
                    over; and if we are called on for a decision, proper notice 
                    shall be given. </p></td>

                    Virginia and Jamaica; that they are goods and chattels; and, 
                    as such, saleable and sold. That James Sommersett is a negro 
                    of Africa, and long before the return of the king's writ was 
                    brought to be sold, and was sold to Charles Steuart, esq. 
                    then in Jamaica, and has not been manumitted since; that Mr. 
                    Steuart, having occasion to transact business, came over hither, 
                    with an intention to return; and brought Sommersett to attend 
                    and abide with him, and to carry him back as soon as the business 
                    should be transacted. That such intention has been, and still 
                    continues; and that the negro did remain till the time of 
                    his departure in the service of his master Mr. Steuart, and 
                    quitted it without his consent; and thereupon, before the 
                    return of the king's writ, the said Charles Steuart did commit 
                    the slave on board the Anne and Mary, to safe custody, to 
                    be kept till he should set sail, and then to be taken with 
                    him to Jamaica, and there sold as a slave. And this is the 
                    cause why he, captain Knowles, who was then and now is, commander 
                    of the above vessel, then and now lying in the river of Thames, 
                    did the said negro, committed to his custody, detain; and 
                    on which he now renders him to the orders of the Court. We 
                    pay all due attention to the opinion of sir Philip Yorke, 
                    and lord chancellor Talbot, whereby they pledged themselves 
                    to the British planters, for all the legal consequences of 
                    slaves coming over to this kingdom or being baptized, recognized 
                    by lord Hardwicke, sitting as chancellor on the 19th of October, 
                    1749, that trover would lie: that a notion had prevailed, 
                    if a negro came over, or became a Christian, he was emancipated, 
                    but no ground in law: that he and lord Talbot, when attorney 
                    and solicitor-general, were of opinion, that no such claim 
                    for freedom was valid; that though the statute of tenures 
                    had abolished villeins regardant to a manor, yet he did not 
                    conceive but that a man might still become a villein in gross, 
                    by confessing himself such in open court. We are so well agreed, 
                    that we think there is no occasion of having it argued (as 
                    I intimated an intention at first,) before all the judges, 
                    as is usual, for obvious reasons, on a return to Habeas Corpus. 
                    The only question before us is, whether the cause on the return 
                    is sufficient? If it is, the negro must be remanded; if it 
                    is not, he must be discharged. Accordingly, the return states, 
                    that the slave departed and refused to serve; whereupon he 
                    was kept, to be sold abroad. So high an act of dominion must 
                    be recognized by the law of the country where it is used. 
                    The power of a master over his slave has been extremely different, 
                    in different countries. The state of slavery is of such a 
                    nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, 
                    moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves 
                    its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself 
                    from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so 
                    odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive 
                    law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the 
                    decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by 
                    the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.</p></td>
