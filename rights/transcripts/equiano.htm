          <td> <p> &#8230;The stench of the hold while we were on the coast was 
              so intolerably loathsome, that it was dangerous to remain there 
              for any time, and some of us had been permitted to stay on the deck 
              for the fresh air; but now that the whole ship's cargo were 
              confined together, it became absolutely pestilential. The closeness 
              of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in 
              the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn 
              himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, 
              so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety 
              of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, 
              of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, 
              as I may call it, of their purchasers. This wretched situation was 
              again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become insupportable; 
              and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often 
              fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and 
              the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost 
              inconceivable. Happily perhaps for myself I was soon reduced so 
              low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost always 
              on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In 
              this situation I expected every hour to share the fate of my companions, 
              some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the point of 
              death, which I began to hope would soon put an end to my miseries. 
              Often did I think many of the inhabitants of the deep much more 
              happy than myself, I envied them the freedom they enjoyed, and as 
              often wished I could change my condition for theirs. Every circumstance 
              I met with served only to render my state more painful, and heighten 
              my apprehensions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites. One 
              day they had taken a number of fishes; and when they had killed 
              and satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit, to our 
              astonishment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them 
              to us to eat, as we expected, they tossed the remaining fish into 
              the sea again, although we begged and prayed for some as well as 
              we could, but in vain; and some of my countrymen, being pressed 
              by hunger, took an opportunity, when they thought no one saw them, 
              of trying to get a little privately; but they were discovered, and 
              the attempt procured them some very severe floggings. One day, when 
              we had a smooth sea and moderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen 
              who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring 
              death to such a life of misery, somehow made through the nettings 
              and jumped into the sea: immediately another quite dejected fellow, 
              who on account of his illness, was suffered to be out of irons, 
              also followed their example; and I believe many more would very 
              soon have done the same if they had not been prevented by the ship's 
              crew, who were instantly alarmed. Those of us that were the most 
              active were in a moment put down under the deck, and there was such 
              a noise and confusion amongst the people of the ship as I never 
              heard before, to stop her, and get the boat out to go after the 
              slaves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but they got the 
              other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully, for thus attempting 
              to prefer death to slavery.</p>
            <p>&#8230;We were not many days in the merchant's custody before 
              we were sold after their usual manner, which is this: - On a signal 
              given, (as the beat of a drum) the buyers rush at once into the 
              yard where the slaves are confined, and make a choice of that parcel 
              they like best. The noise and clamour with which this is attended, 
              and the eagerness visible in the countenances of the buyers, serve 
              not a little to increase the apprehension of the terrified Africans, 
              who may well be supposed to consider them as the ministers of that 
              destruction to which they think themselves devoted. In this manner, 
              without scruple, are relations and friends separated, most of them 
              never to see each other again. I remember in the vessel in which 
              I was brought over, in the men's apartment, there were several 
              brothers, who, in the sale, were sold in different lots; and it 
              was very moving on this occasion to see and hear their cries at 
              parting. O, ye nominal Christians! might not an African ask you, 
              learned you this from your God, who says unto you, Do unto all men 
              as you would men should do unto you? Is it not enough that we are 
              torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and lust 
              of gain? Must every tender feeling be likewise sacrificed to your 
              avarice? Are the dearest friends and relations, now rendered more 
              dear by their separation from their kindred, still to be parted 
              from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of slavery 
              with the small comfort of being together and mingling their sufferings 
              and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children, brothers their 
              sisters, or husbands their wives? Surely this is a new refinement 
              in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for it, thus 
              aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors even to the wretchedness 
              of slavery. </p></td>
