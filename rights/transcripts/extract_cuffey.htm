                  and important trial, it has not been a fair trial, and my request 
                  was not complied with to have a jury of my equals. But the jury 
                  as it is I have no fault to find with; I daresay they have acted 
                  conscientiously. The next reason that I ought not to be sentenced 
                  is on account of the great prejudice that has been raised against 
                  me in particular, for months past. Everybody that hears me is 
                  convinced that almost the whole press of this country, and even 
                  other countries, has been raising a prejudice against me. I 
                  have been taunted by the press. and it has tried to smother 
                  me with ridicule,(a) and it has done everything in its power 
                  to crush me. I crave no pity. I ask no mercy.<br> <em>The prisoner

                  have been an important character in the Chartist movement, I 
                  laid myself out for something of this sort from the first. I 
                  know that a great many men of good moral character are now suffering 
                  in prison only for advocating the cause of the Charter; but, 
                  however, I do not despair of its being carried out yet. There 
                  may be many victims. I am not anxious for martyrdom, but I feel 
                  that, after what I have gone through this week, I have the fortitude 
                  to endure any punishment your lordship can inflict upon me. 
                  I know my cause is good, and I have a self-approving conscience 
                  that will bear me up against anything. and that would bear me 
                  up even to the scaffold; therefore I think I can endure any 
                  punishment proudly. I feel no disgrace at being called a felon.

                    conclusion at which they could have arrived. No reasonable 
                    men could doubt for an instant that, after the scene of the 
                    15th of August, on the evening when the ribbons were given 
                    out and the order of assemblage for the next night was directed, 
                    you and each of you, when the shades of night were descended 
                    upon this metropolis, intended that a course of burning, of 
                    murder and of robbery, should surround this unfortunate city, 
                    if it had been so unfortunate as that your guilty purposes 
                    had not been discovered. That was the primary object you had 
                    in view; and a secondary, no doubt, was that you might assume 
                    the government of this country and govern things in your own 
                    way. Is this to be endured? And when men are brought within 
                    the law and are about to answer for the breach of it, to defy 
                    the law? But your defiance would make no difference in the 
                    judgment of the Court, and, if it were possible to extend 
                    mercy to any of you, wild and insane as you seem to be, that 
                    mercy should be extended.<br>
                    But I cannot conceive that the Court would be performing its 
                    duty to the country if, when such offences as these were brought 
                    home to criminals such as yourselves, it should pass on them 
                    a slight punishment, and should not make an example, a severe 
                    example of all those who are brought within the pale of the 
                    law.<br>
                    The sentence of the Court upon each of you is that for the 
                    offence of which you have been respectively convicted, you 
                    be transported beyond the seas to such place as her Majesty, 
                    by the advice of her Privy Council, shall direct and appoint,
