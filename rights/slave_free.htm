                  <p>The legal position of enslaved Africans in Britain before
                    the abolition of slavery was ambiguous, and further muddied
                    and confused by senior lawyers. Revolutionary uprisings demanding
                    natural justice rocked America in 1776 and France in 1789,
                    but the principles of political and social freedom had limited
                    application, particularly in the case of slaves.</p>

                  <h3>Slaves as Property </h3>
                  <p>Plantation owners in the Americas were dependent upon slaves
                    to ensure high profitability. In Britain, 18th-century laws
                    were designed to support a trade in slaves that was sanctioned
                    by the king and parliament. A decision by the Solicitor General
                    stated that 'Negroes' ought to be 'esteemed goods and commodities
                    within the Trade and Navigation Acts'. Such a ruling permitted
                    slave owners to use property law with regard to their slaves
                    'to recover goods wrongfully detained, lost or damaged' as
                    they would any other property. </p>
                  <p>The use of property law meant that the enslaved were considered
                    not humans, but commodities. This view of Africans would have
                    a detrimental and lasting effect on the Black community well
                    into the 20th century. The historian James Walvin concludes
                    that 'the State, as an institution, dehumanized African men,
                    women and children for its own ends'. </p>

                  <h3>Slaves and Employment </h3>
                  <p>Most plantation owners lived in Britain. They brought their
                    household slaves back with them from trips to the Americas,
                    and used them to perform domestic duties in Britain.</p>
                  <p>An owner's right to his slave's labour was challenged in
                    court in Middlesex in 1690. Katherine Auker accompanied her
                    master, Robert Rich, a Barbados planter, to England. She was
                    tortured and expelled from his home in England, but Rich refused
                    to allow her to work for anyone else. The court decided that
                    Auker was at 'liberty to serve any person until such time
                    as Rich shall return from Barbadoes'. </p>
                  <p>Law reports provide ample evidence of enslaved people in
                    England bringing actions to obtain discharge from enforced
                    employment. Well aware of the brutalities of plantation life,
                    they would often do anything they could to avoid returning
                    to the colonies with their masters. But the judgements they
                    received were often contradictory, and did not bring slavery
                    in Britain to an end.</p>

                <td valign="top"> <h3>The Yorke-Talbot Ruling </h3>
                  <p>One of the justifications advanced by Europeans for the enslavement
                    of Africans had been their heathen and pagan state. But, if
                    being a heathen was reason for enslavement, then might not
                    conversion to Christianity or baptism result in freedom? From
                    1664 onwards a number of American colonies legislated against
                    manumission (the granting of freedom) in such circumstances,
                    but the legal position remained unclear. Eventually, the British
                    courts were asked for clarification, and in 1729 a joint opinion
                    by the Attorney General (Sir Philip Yorke) and Solicitor General
                    (Charles Talbot) attempted to answer a number of questions
                    concerning the status of slaves. The Yorke-Talbot ruling stated:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>We are of the opinion, that a slave, by coming from the
                      West Indies, either with or without his master, to Great
                      Britain or Ireland, doth not become free; and that his master&#8217;s
                      property or right in him is not thereby determined or varied;
                      and baptism doth not bestow freedom on him, nor make any
                      alteration to his temporal condition in these kingdoms.
                      We are also of opinion, that the master may legally compel
                      him to return to the plantations.<br>

                  <h3><a name="somerset"></a>The Somerset Ruling </h3>
                  <p>The celebrated Somerset ruling of 1772 concerned a slave's
                    liberty and status as property. The slave James Somerset (or
                    Sommersett) was the property of a Boston customs official,
                    Charles Stewart. Somerset was brought to England. After two
                    years he escaped, but he was recaptured on 26 November 1771
                    and was forced onto a ship bound for Jamaica. With help from
                    Granville Sharpe, a humanitarian anti-slavery campaigner,
                    a writ of <a href="../glossary.htm#habeas" target="_blank" onClick="PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary.htm#habeas','popup','610','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue"><img src="../graphics/glossary.gif" width="6" height="11" border="0" alt="Glossary - opens new window">habeas
                    corpus</a> was granted by Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice,
                    ordering the captain of the ship on which Somerset was incarcerated
                    to produce Somerset before a court.</p>
                  <p>The case was repeatedly adjourned. Somerset's legal team
                    argued that although slavery was tolerated in the colonies,
                    the Court of King's Bench was bound to apply the law of England.
                    Mansfield ruled in 1772 that 'no master ever was allowed here
                    (England) to take a slave by force to be sold abroad because
                    he deserted from his service...therefore the man must
                    be discharged'. And so James Somerset won his freedom.</p>

                    Many of them misunderstood the ruling to mean that slaves
                    were emancipated in Britain. This was not the case. The decision
                    was that no slave could be forcibly removed from Britain and
                    sold into slavery. </p>
                  <p>Despite Lord Mansfield's ruling, slave owners continued recapturing
                    their runaway slaves and shipping them back to the colonies.
                    Numerous newspaper advertisements of the time show that Black
                    slaves were still being bought and sold in England. A few
                    years later, in 1785, Mansfield himself ruled that 'black
                    slaves in Britain were not entitled to be paid for their labour'
                    (free Black people were, however, paid).</p>
                  <p>The legal status of African slaves in Britain and its colonies
                    remained unclear until the early 19th century. In 1807, with
                    the passing of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, the slave
                    trade became illegal; and 21 years later almost all Black
                    men, women and children held in bondage in the British empire
                    were granted their freedom.</p>
