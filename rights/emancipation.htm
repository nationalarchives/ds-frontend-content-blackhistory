                  <p>With the passing of the <a href="abolition.htm#abolition">Abolition
                    of the Slave Trade Act</a> by the British Parliament in 1807,
                    the attention of campaigners against the slave trade switched
                    to slavery itself. For although the slave trade had been banned,
                    nothing had been done to free the existing enslaved workforce
                    in the British empire. In 1823 religious groups, politicians
                    and supporters from around the country came together to form
                    the Anti-Slavery Society.</p>
                  <h3>Women's Anti-Slavery Associations</h3>
                  <p>During the 1820s and early 1830s, a strong network of women's
                    anti-slavery associations developed. The Birmingham Society
                    played a particularly active role in helping to promote and
                    establish local groups in many parts of Britain. Influenced
                    by the Birmingham Society, over 73 women's associations were
                    founded between 1825 and 1833, which supplied a constant stream
                    of information to rouse public opinion against slavery. </p></td>

                    a basis from which they could pursue their own liberation.
                    They were able to use the terminology of the anti-slavery
                    campaign as a way to articulate some of the inequalities they
                    suffered; and the anti-slavery campaign in many ways set the
                    scene for the women's rights movement. </p>
                  <p>One way in which enslaved Black women in Britain fought against
                    their status was by running away. One such woman was <a href="../culture/literature.htm#mary">Mary
                    Prince</a>, a Bermudan who escaped from her owners shortly
                    after her arrival in London in 1828. Although very particular
                    about the enslaved women it chose to support, the Anti-slavery
                    Society was instrumental in the writing and publishing of
                    Prince's narrative <em>The History of Mary Prince, a West
                    Indian Slave. Related by Herself</em>.</p>
                  <p>This text, which was one of many used by the abolitionists
                    to further their campaign, was in fact the first slave narrative
                    by a woman from the British Caribbean. The preface to it states
                    that the 'idea of writing Mary Prince's history was first
                    suggested by herself. She wished it to be done, she said,
                    that good people in England might hear from a slave what a
                    slave had felt and suffered.'</p>
                  <p>Poignantly, Mary Prince describes her purpose in making her
                    experiences public, despite the painfulness of recalling and
                    articulating her suffering:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Oh the horrors of slavery! - How the thought of it pains
                      my heart! But the truth ought to be told of it; and what
                      my eyes have seen I think it is my duty to relate; for few
                      people in England know what slavery is. I have been a slave
                      - I have felt what a slave feels, and I know what a slave
                      knows; and I would have all the good people in England to
                      know it too, that they may break our chains, and set us
                      free. </p>

                  <p>By 1824 there were more than 200 branches of the Anti-Slavery
                    Society in Britain - an indicator of increasing support for
                    the fight against slavery. The campaign was one of many taking
                    place, for this was a period of great economic and social
                    change both in Britain and in the British colonies. It was
                    increasingly evident that the plantation system in the British
                    Caribbean was in need of reform and transformation. Factory
                    owners in England were being forced to consider the rights
                    and needs of workers; and with shifts in international borders
                    and trade, British planters were facing new forms of competition
                    in a changing world market. Moreover, deprived of their cargoes
                    of enslaved men and women, British ships now crossed the Atlantic
                    fully laden - with raw materials such as cotton and sugar
                    - on the return journey only. Thus, the abolition of slavery
                    in Britain was waged in a society already in a state of economic,
                    political and social flux. As C. L. R. James was to later
                    argue, the abolition of slavery was to be an integral part
                    of the development of modern British society. </p></td>

                  <p>While William Wilberforce, Lord Brougham and others pushed
                    the debate forward in Parliament, enslaved people in <a href="../africa_caribbean/caribbean_resistance.htm">the
                    Caribbean</a> continued to fight individually, as well as
                    collectively, against slavery. As the reporting of the campaign
                    gained momentum in the press - both in Britain and throughout
                    the British Caribbean - rebellions and resistance increased.
                    For example, in 1823 in Demerara, in British Guiana, over
                    13,000 slaves joined a rebellion because they felt that the
                    local plantation owners had refused to obey British orders
                    to free them.</p>
                  <p>Planters in the Caribbean and their supporters and pro-slavery
                    representatives in the British Parliament continued to argue
                    for slavery. From time to time this opposition erupted into
                    violence, and in some cases missionaries in the West Indies
                    who were in favour of emancipation found their churches burned
                    by aggrieved planters. </p></td>

                  <p>In the 1830s, a number of Acts were passed that fundamentally
                    changed British society and the lives of millions of people
                    living in British colonies. The Reform Act of 1832 brought
                    an end to the old system whereby most MPs were allowed to
                    buy their seats in Parliament. The new Parliament of 1833
                    included men (women were not as yet allowed to become MPs)
                    who were connected with the new textile industries based in
                    Britain. In August 1833, the Slave Emancipation Act was passed,
                    giving all slaves in the British empire their freedom, albeit
                    after a set period of years. Plantation owners received compensation
                    for the 'loss of their slaves' in the form of a government
                    grant set at &pound;20,000,000. In contrast, enslaved people
                    received no compensation and continued to face much hardship.
                    They remained landless, and the wages offered on the plantations
                    after emancipation were extremely low.</p>
                  <p>The 1833 Act did not come into force until 1 August 1834.
                    The first step was the freeing of all children under six.
                    However, although the many thousands of enslaved people in
                    the British West Indies were no longer legally slaves after
                    1 August 1834, they were still made to work as unpaid apprentices
                    for their former masters. These masters continued to ill-treat
                    and exploit them. Enslaved people in the British Caribbean
                    finally gained their freedom at midnight on 31 July 1838.
