                  continued singing in their own language, and that they ended 
                  every verse, by way of chorus, with the following two lines

                  the boiling house; as the negroes are all musically inclined, 
                  and make extempore songs, as Mr Parke truly observes, upon any 
                  thing that strikes them either in a grave, or ludicrous light. 
                  The burthen of their melancholly ditty therefore at that aweful 
                  period, was suppos[e]d merely to express, that <u>day</u>, the 
                  season of <u>labour</u>, was for the master; and that <u>night</u> 
                  that of <u>rest</u>, for the slave.<br>
                  The signal for slaughter was given by the head boilers blowing 
                  out the lamp nearest to him. In an instant, the unfortunate 
                  whites present were seiz'd and murder'd. This account was given 
                  by one of the insurgents who surrender'd himself on the faith 
                  of a proclamation issued some time after. Having made this bloody 
                  beginning, they proceeded to the mansion house to finish the 
                  second act of this tragedy. </td>
