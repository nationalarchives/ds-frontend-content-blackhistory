              <br>
              <strong>Barbary [States] </strong>&nbsp;North of Africa - now parts

              <br>
              <strong>Cabo buen Esperan&ccedil;a</strong> &nbsp;Cape of Good Hope.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Guinny </strong> &nbsp;Guinea. Refers to a stretch of the 
              west coast of Africa, never very well-defined, but much larger than 
              the area of the coast now occupied by Guinea and Guinea-Bissau.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Rio Noons</strong> &nbsp;Rio Nunez. River estuary - now

              <br>
              <strong>Calsaman&ccedil;a </strong>&nbsp;Casamance. This appears 
              to refer to the river rather than the region of this name - now 
              in Senegal.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Rio Grande</strong> &nbsp;Appears to be the Corubal river, 
              now in Guinea-Bissau.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Catchao</strong> &nbsp;Cacheu (town and river - now in Guinea-Bissau) 
              or Cati&oacute; (town in Guinea-Bissau). The former is more likely, 
              as it is south of the Rio Grande/Corubal, whereas Cacheu is north, 
              and the list seems to be running generally north to south.<br>

              <strong>Cestos</strong> &nbsp;Cess river. Now in Liberia. The river

              <strong>Luaqua</strong> &nbsp;Probably 'Quaqua' (not located).<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Cape Trespontes </strong>&nbsp;Perhaps Cape Three Points, 
              in Ghana.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Cormentine</strong> &nbsp;Kormantyn (Cormantyn or Kormantine),

              <br>
              <strong>Castel de Mina</strong> &nbsp;Elmina, in Ghana. This was 
              a British fort in the 17th century.<br>

              <strong>Acra</strong> &nbsp;Accra. Now in Ghana.<br>
