                <td valign="top" ><h3><a name="why"></a>Why Asian and Black History?</h3>
                  <p>There were many Asian and Black people living in Britain
                    throughout the period covered by this exhibition (1500-1850).
                    They formed an integral part of British society, whether labouring
                    as servants in country houses, enlisting in the armed forces,
                    marrying in parish churches, engaging with literary and artistic
                    life, or challenging the repressive laws of the day. For many
                    places in Britain, we cannot speak of a separate 'Black community'
                    at this time - Black people were integrated in the wider society,
                    working and living with their White compatriots.</p>
                  <p>The word 'Black' is used here to denote people
                    of African descent; 'Asian' to describe people
                    of South Asian origin (from modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,
                    the area that formed the British territory of India); and
                    'White' to indicate people of European ancestry.
                    Words used to describe categories of people are always approximate
                    and imperfect, and these have been selected as the nearest
                    to satisfactory in this context. </p>
                  <p>Why, then, does this web exhibition look specifically at
                    Asian and Black people in Britain? Because this aspect of
                    our heritage has largely been lost. It is often assumed that
                    the population of Britain was entirely White at this period.
                    How many people know, for example, that one of the leaders
                    of the radical Chartist movement, which fought for the vote
                    in the 19th century, was Black? Or that Elizabeth I tried
                    to expel a number of Black people from England? Or that thousands
                    of Black men, and probably even a few Black women, fought
                    in the British army and navy during the Napoleonic Wars? This
                    exhibition aims to reclaim some of this history and make it
                    more widely known. </p></td>

                  <p>There is much historical evidence about Black people in Britain,
                    and this exhibition explores some of it. But many subjects
                    have not been researched, and there is much that we still
                    do not know. </p>
                  <p>One problem is that Black and Asian people are not always
                    identified in the records. Sometimes - for example, in many
                    army service records - a person's complexion is described,
                    and sometimes the records may say that she or he is a 'Black',
                    'Negro' or 'Moor'. But frequently no such indication is given.
                    Nor is there any way of being certain how many Black and Asian
                    people lived here - nor, indeed, what the total population
                    was, since the first national census was not taken until 1801
                    (and even that was of limited scope).</p>
                  <p>Often, it is impossible to tell whether Black people referred
                    to in records were free or enslaved. It should not be assumed
                    that a person described as a 'Negro' in the 16th, 17th or
                    18th centuries was a slave. Many Black people were never enslaved.
                    And those that were, might be granted or buy their freedom,
                    or claim it when they entered the military. </p></td>

                  <p> From the late Middle Ages, as Europeans began to make direct
                    contact with Africa, the number of Africans and people of
                    African descent in Britain began to increase. The most important
                    cause of these migrations was probably the slave trade. British
                    involvement in the trade began in the 16th century and had
                    reached huge proportions by the 18th. Over a period of 400
                    years, Europeans transported many millions of Africans to
                    labour in their colonies in the Americas. These migrations

                <td><p>Some of the enslaved Africans, or their children or grandchildren,
                    ended up in Britain. For example, estate owners from the West
                    Indies brought their household slaves to Britain to work as
                    servants. Here, they were not necessarily treated any more
                    humanely than they were on the plantations. </p>
                  <p>Advertisements in English newspapers show how slaves were
                    traded in Britain. For example, in 1756 the <em>Liverpool
                    Advertiser</em> carried a request for a 'Black Boy of
                    deep black complexion&#8230;not above 15 nor under 12 years
                    of age'. Africans were also bought and sold as slaves
                    in British ports.Yet not all the Black people who arrived
                    in Britain during this period were enslaved. For example,
                    Africans were recruited as sailors on the numerous slaving
                    voyages of British traders, and it is likely that some of
                    these sailors were free. Free Black people were also recruited
                    into the Royal Navy. Some of these sailors will have settled
                    and raised families in and around Britain's ports.</p>
                  <p>Africans also visited Britain for other reasons. Some were
                    merchants conducting business with British traders, and others
                    were the children of wealthy African rulers or European planters
                    who came to Europe to be educated. For example, Francis Williams,
                    born in 1700, was a Jamaican of African descent who studied
                    at Cambridge University. On his return to the West Indies,
                    he ran a school in Spanish Town. </p></td>

                  <p>Africans appear to have been more numerous than Asians in Britain between 1500-1850. This is because African people had been travelling to Europe in larger numbers since the medieval period. It was Britain's subsequent involvement in the slave trade that then had the greatest influence over the size and pattern of its Black population. Indians first arrived in Britain mainly because Britain traded with, and later colonised, India but it was only in the 1840s that large numbers of Indians began to migrate, mainly to the Caribbean, as <a href="../india/forced.htm"><img src="../graphics/glossary.gif" border="0">indentured
                    labourers</a>. Some of these migrants or their descendants
                    eventually settled in Britain.</p>
                  <p>There were, however, more Indians in Britain at this period than we know about. They are often hard to identify in the records. Sometimes they are referred to as ‘Inde’, a term similar to the modern ‘ethnic’. Moreover many of those called Indians in early modern English records are Native Americans who were then more frequent visitors to the country. Officials also sometimes referred to Indians and Chinese people simply as 'Black' and because many of them weren't Christians, they cannot be expected to feature frequently in parish records of baptisms, marriages and burials.</p></td>

                  <p>Although the British government tried several times to get
                    rid of groups of Black people, there was clearly a settled
                    Black and Asian population here throughout the period 1500-1850.
                    Although we do not know their numbers, there are some (rather
                    contradictory) clues. In 1764, for example, the <em>Gentleman's
                    Magazine</em> estimated that 20,000 Black people lived in
                    London, a figure accepted by the anti-slavery campaigner Granville
                    Sharp. In 1772, Lord Mansfield put the number in the country
                    as a whole at 15,000.</p>
                  <p>A poignant record of Black people's lives and deaths
                    in Britain is provided by surviving tombstones. A famous and
                    frequently quoted one is that of 18-year-old Scipio Africanus,
                    who died on 21 December 1720. He is buried in Henbury cemetery,
                    near Bristol. Another is that of 'Sambo' of Sunderland
                    Point, Lancaster, whose inscription reads 'Here lies
                    Poor Sambo A faithful Negro' - an epitaph that typifies
                    the patronising attitudes towards Black people at the time. This web exhibition offers an introduction to some of these sources, particularly those in the National Archives. It cannot tell the whole story but it does start to find some of the missing pieces of the jigsaw.</p></td>
