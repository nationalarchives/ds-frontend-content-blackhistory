      <p><strong><a name="eastindies">East Indies</a></strong><br>
        A general geographical description that frequently encompassed South Asia, 
        the lands of Malaysia, and the islands of the Indian Ocean. In the context 
        of this exhibition, it is often used in this sense. In Shakespeare's <em>The 
        Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (c. 1598-1601), Falstaff says of Mistress 
        Page and Mistress Ford 'They shall be exchequers to me; they shall 
        be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both.' Today, 
        the term is commonly used to refer to the Malay archipelago. The Dutch 
        colony known as the Netherlands East Indies became Indonesia in the 20th 
        century.

      <p><strong><a name="enclosure">Enclosure</a></strong><br>
        The practice of enclosing common land to turn it into private landholdings. 
        This practice increased substantially during the last two decades of the 
        18th century, often to the disadvantage of the poor.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="enlightenment">Enlightenment</a></strong><br>
        An 18th-century intellectual movement arguing that human reason could 
        be used to combat ignorance, superstition and tyranny and to build a better 
        world. The Enlightenment had profound consequences for the intellectual 
        and political development of western Europe - and beyond.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="equiano">Equiano, Olaudah </a></strong><br>
        Equiano was born in Africa around 1745. As a boy of 11 he was kidnapped 
        and transported to the West Indies to work as a slave. He was bright, 
        found work on English ships, and learned to read and write. In England 
        he converted to Christianity and was baptised 'Gustavus Vassa'. He married 
        an English woman from Cambridge and had a family. In 1789 he published 
        his autobiography, <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah 
        Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African</em>. </p>

      A writ ordering that a detained person be brought before a court or judge, 
      at a specified time and place, in order to determine whether such detention 
      is lawful. The right of any citizen to obtain the issue of such a writ is 
      regarded as one of the most fundamental civil liberties. In England, writs 
      beginning with the instruction 'Habeas corpus' (Latin for 'Have the body&#8230;', 
      meaning 'You are to produce the person detained') were first issued in the 
      13th century. The law relating to them was formalised by the Habeas Corpus 
      Act of 1679. 
      <p><strong><a name="hinduism">Hinduism</a></strong><br>
        Also referred to as Sanatana Dharma, the eternal faith, Hinduism is not

        along the River Thames at Chatham, Deptford, Woolwich and Sheerness, usually 
        near dockyards or arsenals so that prisoners could be used there as labourers.</p>

        Runaway slaves who lived in the mountains of Jamaica; these communities

        Originally, this term was applied to Muslims who conquered parts of Spain

        15th century; it also denotes people from Morocco or Mauritania in North 
        Africa. In Britain it was often used to refer to any Black person (particularly 
        Muslims). The word 'Moor' appears in Shakespearean literature. It was 
        spelt in a variety of ways (such as 'more', 'moir', 'moorish' 'moris' 
        'moryen') and often combined with 'black' or 'blak', as in 'black moor', 
        'blackamoor' and 'black more'. 'Blackamoor' was also used as a synonym
