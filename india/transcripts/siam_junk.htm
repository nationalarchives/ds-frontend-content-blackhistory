          <td>...The Inhabitants are Siams, about 2000 Soules, and about 2 or 
            300 black Chrisitans who call themselves Porteguese. It is under the 
            Goverment of the King of Siam, who sends two Chinese Govern[ors] every 
            3 or 4 years to rule them, by which meanes 'tis greatly oppress'd, 
            allmost depopulated, and the trade ruined. Often vex'd with 
            discents and depredations by the Malay Piratts. Lying so farr from 
            Court that it is little regarded. The people inexpressibly lazy, all 
            property being perfectly precarious; beggars to a man both Govern[or]s 
            and Governed. Yett notwithstanding it is at present such a scene of 
            misery and want, it needs nothing but a good Governm[en]t to make 
            it a very happy place and the Inhabitants very rich. They would be 
            glad to joyn or come under any foreigners for their protection, knowing 
            they would live much happier, and not be oppress'd as they at 
            present are 
            <hr size="1" noshade> &#8230;The Commodities the Island affords and can afford 
            are as followeth. 
            <p>Tin. All the south parts are full of Tin Mines lying high and near 
              the surface of the earth, which however the Natives for want of 
              the Art our European miners are masters off, find difficult enough 
              to come at; which added to their naturall sloth and the just fear 
              they live in of being rich (which would render 'em liable 
              to greater inconvenience then living just from hand to mouth) Are 
              the causes that very little Tin is dug. When they gett into a hole 
              five or ten foot deep (which is what they call a mine) if they meet 
              with any water they leave off immediatly and goe no further let 
              the vein be never so rich (because they can not drain the water 
              off). They never goe under ground to follow a Vein, but poke what 
              they can with a stick of hard wood, or some poor ill contrived Iron 
              tool as farr as they can reach round them, and then leave of and 
              goe and sink a hole in some other place till they find a Vein. And 
              of such places as these they have hundreds for all the south parts 
              of the Island are like so many gravell pitts. Even in melting the 
              oar they are very wastfull, very inexpert and Tedious. They often 
              give 25 per cent for melting, and this intirely for want of art 
              in making furnaces, contriving bellowes and other melting conveniences, 
              for they have charcoal enough for little or nothing. Yet for all 
              this they gett above 100 tonns a year. So that any person may judge 
              what a vast quantity may be gott by a few expert miners and slaves 
              that may be had very cheap from Madegascar the Coast of Chormandell 
              and Bengall.<br>
