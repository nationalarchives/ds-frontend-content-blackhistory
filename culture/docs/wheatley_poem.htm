          <td><p>Reproduced here is a poem, written in 1768, that was included 
              in the 1814 edition (p. 446) of <em>The Interesting Narrative of 
              the Life of Olaudah Equiano</em> or <em>Gustavus Vassa, the African</em>, 
              'To which are added, Poems on various subjects, by Phillis Wheatley, 
              Negro Servant to Mr. John Wheatley of Boston in New England'. The 
              poem was originally published in 1773, in Phillis Wheatley's <em>Poems 
              on Various Subjects: Religious and Moral</em>.<br>
              <br>
              Often described as &#8216;the Christian poetess&#8217;, or in similar 
              terms, Wheatley wrote poems that were morally instructive or imbued 
              with religious feeling, such as meditations on paintings or sermons 
              and eulogies on the death of a child or clergyman. Only occasionally 
              did she write about slavery or the slave trade. The poem reproduced 
              here is one example. <br>
              <br>
              Even in this poem, however, Wheatley is more concerned with the 
              &#8216;civilising&#8217; effects of Christianity upon Africans and 
              on establishing the equality of all before God. The latter was a 
              major concern, as it was common for baptised slaves to be regarded 
              not as Christian but merely &#8216;Christianised&#8217; and thus 
              not protected from being enslaved. <br>
              <br>
              Occasionally Wheatley was more overt. In a 1772 poem addressed to 
              the Earl of Dartmouth (the recently appointed Secretary of State 
              for the North American colonies, who she hoped would establish a 
              more equal relationship between Britain and America), Wheatley exclaimed:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><em>...I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate <br>
                Was snatch&#8217;d from Afric&#8217;s fancy&#8217;d happy seat: 
                <br>
                What pangs excruciating must molest, <br>
                What sorrows labour in my parent&#8217;s breast? <br>
                Steel&#8217;d was that soul and by no misery mov&#8217;d <br>
                That from a father seiz&#8217;d his babe belov&#8217;d: <br>
                Such such my case. And can I then but pray <br>
                Others may never feel tyrannic sway?</em><br>
                <br>
              </p>
