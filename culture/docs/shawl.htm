          <td>By the 1850s, shawls based on Indian designs were highly fashionable 
            in Britain. Paisley, in Scotland, had been one of the first manufacturing 
            centres in Britain to try to reproduce traditional Kashmiri patterns. 
            With new technology in the form of jacquard looms from France enabling 
            them to create and reproduce more elaborate designs, British manufacturers 
            were able to develop their own style, and the &#8216;Paisley&#8217; 
            patterns that we know today were born. <br>
            <br>
            The design of this shawl (which was probably made in Paisley) shows 
            both French and Indian influences. The elongated pine cones and coloured 
            end pieces are based on Indian patterns, but some of the colours (such 
            as burgundy) would never have been used on an authentic Indian shawl. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By the 1850s, the Kashmiri shawl industry in India was largely controlled 
            by European agents, who brought their own pattern books, with these 
            new British designs, for local weavers to copy.<br>
