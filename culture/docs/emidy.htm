          <td>Joseph Emidy (also spelt Emedy or Emedee) had been second violin 
            in the orchestra of the Lisbon opera house before being impressed 
            into the Royal Navy in 1795. Once discharged in 1799, he resumed his 
            career as a professional musician both in Falmouth and Truro, to where 
            he later moved with his family. Emidy also privately taught a variety 
            of instruments, including the violin. <br>
            <br>
            Over the years, he became a highly regarded and popular performer 
            both at local balls and parties and among the local &#8216;harmonic 
            societies&#8217; (or amateur orchestras) and concert groups. For some 
            time, he was leader of the Harmonic Society of Falmouth. This untitled 
            anonymous drawing almost certainly shows Emidy performing with a harmonic 
            society in Truro, in 1808. <br>
            <br>
            Emidy wrote a number of musical compositions, many of which were performed 
            at local concerts and benefits with great success. Fears, however, 
            that his colour would render him &#8216;unacceptable&#8217; to London 
            musical circles meant that none of his compositions gained a wider 
            audience and, unfortunately, no copies of his work appear to have 
            survived. After his death, one of his former pupils, the anti-slavery 
            politician James Silk Buckingham, described Emidy&#8217;s work as 
            an &#8216;achievement of extraordinary perfection&#8217;.<br>
