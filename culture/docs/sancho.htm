          <td><p>Sancho was employed in the household of the Duke of Montagu for 
              most of his adult life, before opening up a grocery business in 
              Mayfair in the early 1770s. He moved in literary and artistic circles, 
              gaining a reputation as a connoisseur of the arts and establishing 
              friendships with the writer Laurence Sterne (author of <em>Tristram 
              Shandy</em>) and actor/manager David Garrick. <br>
              <br>
              <em>The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho</em> were first published 
              in 1782 and ran to a number of later editions. This engraving made 
              in 1802, after a portrait by Thomas Gainsborough, was probably taken 
              from the frontispiece of one of them. As well as correspondence 
              concerning slavery and the slave trade, Sancho&#8217;s letters contain 
              comments on contemporary British life and are full of references 
              to his circle of friends and his love of music, the theatre and 
              his family. About his wife, in one letter he engagingly writes: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>&#8216;Dame Sancho would be better if she cared less. - I 
                am her barometer - If a sigh escapes me, it is answered by a tear 
                in her eye. - I oft assume a gaiety to illume her dear sensibility 
                with a smile - which twenty years ago almost bewitched me: - and 
                MARK! - after twenty year enjoyment constitutes my highest pleasure!&#8217;</em></p>
