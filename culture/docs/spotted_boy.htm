          <td valign="top">St Bartholomew's Fair, held in London each year over 
            a two week period in August and September, was a focus for the fascination 
            in the 18th and 19th centuries with &#8217;prodigies of nature&#8217;, 
            such as bearded women, living skeletons, &#8216;seal boys&#8217;, 
            fairy children, and the like. One of these &#8216;curiosities&#8217;, 
            who may have been exhibited at the fair, was George Alexander Gratton 
            - &#8216;an extraordinary spotted boy&#8217; from the Caribbean - 
            whose likeness is shown here. <br>
            <br>
            Gratton had been brought to Britain by John Richardson to be an exhibit 
            in one of his shows. Richardson had paid 1,000 guineas for him, a 
            huge amount of money for the day, and must have been confident of 
            making a profit from his &#8217;attraction.&#8217; This engraving, 
            published in 1809, may be similar to the kind of advertising that 
            Richardson used. Gratton - who was compared to a Dalmation dog - may 
            have suffered from vitiligo, a skin disorder affecting pigmentation. 
            His spots could well have been exaggerated by the artist. <br>
            <br>
            Gratton died in 1813 and is buried at All Saints Church in Marlow, 
            Buckinghamshire.<br>
