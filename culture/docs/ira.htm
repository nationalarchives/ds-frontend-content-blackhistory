          <td>Black actors in the 19th century would generally be given only a 
            limited choice of roles and were invariably typecast as servants, 
            slaves or foreign villains, or as comic relief. Despite his prominence 
            as one of the most famous Black actors of the day, Ira Aldridge often 
            suffered the same restrictions.<br>
            <br>
            In this engraving by J. Hollis (after William Paine) he is seen in 
            costume as Mungo in <em>The Padlock</em> - a comedy role enjoyed by 
            the <em>Illustrated London News</em> theatre critic, who described 
            it as 'very amusing' during the course of his review of Aldridge's 
            performance as <a href="zanga.htm">Zanga</a> in <em>The Revenge</em>.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike many of his contemporaries, however, Aldridge was able to forge 
            a career that included a variety of roles, including Shakespearian 
            tragedy, with considerable success. He was not, of course, without 
            detractors and alongside genuine criticism, there was often considerable 
            racial and pro-slavery abuse. Examples of both praise and scorn are 
            reproduced on this web page. <br> <br>
