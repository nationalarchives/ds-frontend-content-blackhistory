          <td><p>This engraving of Equiano is probably based on the frontispiece 
              of his autobiography, <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life 
              of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa, the African</em>, which was 
              published in 1789 and immediately became a bestseller. <br>
              <br>
              In his autobiography, Equiano describes not only how he was kidnapped 
              into slavery but also how, many years later, he gained his freedom. 
              His master, a merchant named Robert King, had promised freedom if 
              Equiano could raise the &pound;40 he had paid for him. Working on 
              one of King&#8217;s ships, Equiano was able to do a little trading 
              on his own account and by July 1766 he had accumulated sufficient 
              funds: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>&#8216;When I got to the office and acquainted the Register 
                with my errand, he congratulated me on the occasion, and told 
                me he would draw up my manumission for half price, which was a 
                guinea. I thanked him for his kindness; and, having received it 
                and paid him, I hastened to my master to get him to sign it, that 
                I might be fully released. Accordingly he signed the manumission 
                that day; so that, before night, I who had been a slave in the 
                morning, trembling at the will of another, was become my own master, 
                and completely free. I thought this was the happiest day I had 
                ever experienced; and my joy was still heightened by the blessings 
                and prayers of many of the sable race, particularly the aged, 
                to whom my heart had ever been attached with reverence.&#8217;</em></p>
