          <td><p>William Henry Lane, known as Juba, was perhaps the greatest of 
              the Black American dancers and musicians who astonished the British 
              theatre-going public in the 1840s and 1850s. The <em>Illustrated 
              London News</em>, in the article from which this drawing is taken, 
              enthused about his dances as follows: </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>&#8216;&#8230;how could Juba enter into their wonderful complications 
                so naturally? How could he tie his legs into such knots, and fling 
                them about so recklessly, or make his feet twinkle until you lose 
                sight of them altogether in his energy. The great Boz immortalised 
                him; and he deserved the glory thus conferred.&#8217; </em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Lane was born in Mississippi about 1825 and died in London while 
              in his late twenties. He took as his stage name that of a dance 
              created by the slaves in America, although the word itself has much 
              earlier origins - in the African dance &#8216;djouba&#8217;. <br>
              <br>
              Lane performed with various minstrel troops, including, unusually, 
              White companies - and even topped the bill. But however feted Juba 
              and other Black dancers were, how might they have been received 
              if their style had been more European or classical?<br>
