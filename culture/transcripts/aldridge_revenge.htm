                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ira Aldridge, the African 
                  tragedian, made his first appearance at the Surrey Theatre on 
                  Monday evening, 20th ult., as <em>Zanga</em>, in the &quot;Revenge.&quot; 
                  Our illustration represents the last scene of the tragedy, wherein 
                  he is trampling on the prostrate <em>Don Alonzo</em>. His reception 
                  throughout the performance was flattering; and, as the play 
                  progressed, the applause became enthusiastic. Mr. Aldridge possesses 
                  an excellent voice, commanding figure, and expressive countenance; 
                  to which he adds the advantages of education and study. His 
                  dress, which is novel and picturesque, reminds one of the portraits 
                  of Abd-el Kader. Throughout the play he more than realised the 
                  high encomiums that had previously been passed upon him; and 
                  many who ridiculed the idea of a native-born African successfully 
                  representing a dramatic character, retired with very different 
                  feelings. Nor is his talent confined to tragedy. His representation 
                  of <em>Mungo, </em>in &quot;The Padlock,&quot; is a laughable 
                  performance, differing entirely from the Ethiopian absurdities 
                  we have been taught to look upon as correct portraitures; his 
                  total <em>abandon</em> is very amusing. He re-appeared on the 
                  27th, as <em>Othello</em>, with great success.</td>
