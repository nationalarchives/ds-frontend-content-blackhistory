                <td>She does not know when she left her native place she being 
                  very young when she came to the Cape: the Brother of her late 
                  Master, Peter C&aelig;sar, brought her to the Cape: She came 
                  with her own consent with Peter C&aelig;sar and was taken into 
                  the service of Henrick C&aelig;sar as his nursery maid; She 
                  came by her own consent to England and was promised half of 
                  the money for exhibiting her person - She agreed to come to 
                  England for a period of six years; She went personally to the 
                  Government in Company with Henrick C&aelig;sar to ask permission 
                  to go to England: Mr Dunlop promised to send her back after 
                  that period at his own expence and to send the money belonging 
                  to her with her - She is kindly treated and has every thing 
                  she wants; Has no complaints to make against her Master or those 
                  that exhibit her: is perfectly happy in her present situation: 
                  has not desire whatever of returning to her own country not 
                  even for the purpose of seeing her two Brothers and four Sisters: 
                  wishes to stay here because she likes the Country and has money 
                  given her by her Master of a Sunday when she rides about in 
                  a Coach for a couple of hours - Her father was in the habit 
                  of going with Cattle from the interior to the Cape and was killed 
                  in one of those Journeys by the &quot;Bosmen&quot;. her mother 
                  died twenty years ago she has a Child by a Drummer at the Cape 
                  with whom she lived for about two years yet being always in 
                  the employ of Henrick C&aelig;sar; the child is since dead - 
                  She is to receive one half of the money received for exhibiting 
                  herself and Mr. Dunlop the other half - She is not desirous 
                  of changing her present situation - no personal violence or 
                  threats have been used by any individual against her; she has 
                  two Black Boys to wait upon her: One of the men assists her 
                  in the morning when she is nearly compleatly attired for the 
                  purpose of fastening the ribbon round her waist - her dress 
                  is too cold and &#710; she has complained of this to Henrick 
                  C&aelig;sar who promised her warmer Cloathes; Her Age she says 
                  to be twenty two and that her stay at the Cape was three years 
                  - To the various questions we put to her whether if she chose 
                  at any time to discontinue her person being exhibited, She might 
                  do so, we could not draw a satisfactory Answer from her - She 
                  understands very little of the Agreement made with her by Mr. 
                  Dunlop on the twenty ninth October 1810 - and which Agreement 
                  She produced to us - The time of Examination lasted for about 
                  three hours - and the questions put to her were put in such 
                  a language as to be understood by her. - and these Deponents 
                  say they were informed by the said female that she could neither 
                  read or write. - </td>
