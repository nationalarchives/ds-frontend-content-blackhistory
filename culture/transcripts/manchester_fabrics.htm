                  that has lately been set up at Manchester in this Country; together 
                  with an Account of the prices at which they are retailed by 
                  the Drapers, which we particularly recommend to your very serious 
                  attention and observation. The great degree of perfection to 
                  which this Manufacture is already arrived, although at present 
                  only in its infant State; the prices, which are 20 P[er] Cent 
                  under our own; together with the attention which we doubt not 
                  will be innveariedly applied by all the Persons concerned therein 
                  towards further Improvements, are circumstances which cannot 
                  but justly alarm us for so important a branch of our Commerce. 
                  If once the Manufacturers of this Country can vie with us either 
                  in the quality, or price, of this, or any other articles of 
                  our Trade, we shall find them most powerful rivals at every 
                  Market where those articles are vended. We doubt not therefore 
                  but but you will exert yourselves to the utmost in causing the 
                  Manufacturers at Bengal to pay every attention not only to an 
                  improvement of the Fabric of Muslins but also to a reduction 
                  of the prices, as both on the one and the other will depend 
                  very much our future success in this Article. </td>
