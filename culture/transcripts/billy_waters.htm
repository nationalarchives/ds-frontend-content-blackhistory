                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eccentric Billy Waters, 
                  whose conspicuous character in <em>Life in London, </em>gained 
                  him so much notoriety; bade adieu to this life yesterday morning, 
                  after being ten days in St. Gile's workhouse, in a lingering 
                  condition. Poor Billy endeavoured up to the period of his illness 
                  to obtain for a wife and two children; what he termed &quot;an 
                  honest living by the scraping of cat-gut,&quot; by which he 
                  originally amassed a considerable portion of <em>browns</em> 
                  (half-pence) at the West end of the town, where his hat and 
                  feathers, with his peculiar antics, excited much mirth and attention. 
                  Billy latterly became unfortunate, which he attributed to the 
                  production of <em>Tom and Jerry</em>, with whom he was made 
                  to take his <em>Madeary </em>(Madeira), and treat &quot;bags 
                  of victuals&quot; with contempt; but, however, he died very 
                  poor, and was obliged, prior to his death, to part with his 
                  old friend, the fiddle, for a trifling sum at the pawnbrokers; 
                  and the wooden <em>pin</em> (leg) which had so often supported 
                  Billy, would have shared the same fate, but its extensive service 
                  had rendered it worthless though it had twice saved poor Billy 
                  from the penalties of the <em>Tread Mill.</em> He was formerly 
                  a sailor, and he received a trifling pension since he left the 
                  service. A short time prior to his death he was elected King 
                  of a party of Beggars in St. Giles's, in consequence of his 
                  notoriety. He resided with his family in the house of Mrs. Fitzgerald, 
                  Church street, St. Giles's. His remains were yesterday removed 
                  from the Workhouse, to the New Burial Ground, St. Pancras, where 
                  he was interred. He was followed to the grave by his wife and 
                  children, with a few old friends - some <em>professional</em> 
                  ones. He was forty-five years of age.</td>
