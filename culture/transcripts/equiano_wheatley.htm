            sent by the Author's Master<br>
            to the Publisher. 
            <p>PHILLIS was brought from <em>Africa</em> to <em>America</em>, in 
              the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight Years of Age, Without any 
              Assistance from School Education, and by only what she was taught 
              in the Family, she, in sixteen Months Time from her Arrival, attained 
              the English Language, to which she was an utter Stranger before, 
              to such a Degree, as to read any, the most difficult Parts of the 
              Sacred Writings, to the great Astonishment of all who heard her.</p>
            <p>As to her WRITING, her own Curiosity led her to it; and this she 
              learnt in so short a Time, that in the Year 1765, she wrote a Letter 
              to the Rev. Mr OCCUM, the <em>Indian</em> Minister, while in <em>England</em>.</p>
            <p>She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue, and has 
              made some Progress in it. This Relation is given by her Master who 
              bought her, and with whom she now lives.</p>
            <p>JOHN WHEATLEY.</p>
