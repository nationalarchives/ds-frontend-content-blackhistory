                <td>Zachary Macaulay of Birchin Lane London Merchants Thomas Gisborne-Babington 
                  of the same place Merchant and Peter Van Wageninge of Water 
                  Lane Thames Street London Gentlemen Severally make oath and 
                  say and first this Deponent Zachary Macaulay for himself saith 
                  that he is Secretary to an Institution called the African Institution 
                  the object of which is the civilization of Africa and the said 
                  Zachary Macaulay having understood from different public advertisements 
                  and otherwise that a native of south Africa denominated the 
                  Hottentot Venus of a most extraordinary or unnatural shape was 
                  publicly exhibited for Money in Piccadilly he was desirous if 
                  possible of learning under what circumstances she came to England 
                  and whether she was made a public spectacle with her own free 
                  will and consent or whether she was compelled to exhibit herself 
                  and was desirous of returning to her own country as the said 
                  Institution would be anxious in that case to restore her to 
                  her country and friends and therefore this Deponent Zachary 
                  Macaulay as Secretary to the said Institution went on Thursday 
                  the eleventh day of this present Month of October to Piccadilly 
                  in order to see the female in question and having paid two shillings 
                  was admitted into the room where she is usually exhibited And 
                  this Deponent saith that he found a stage of about two or three 
                  feet in height erected at one end of the room upon which the 
                  said female was exhibited with a small recess at one end of 
                  the said stage into which the said female occasionally retired 
                  And this Deponent saith that the said female was cloathed in 
                  a dress resembling her complexion which is very dark and her 
                  dress was so tight that her shapes above and the enormous size 
                  of her posterior parts are as visible as if the said female 
                  were naked and the dress is evidently intended to give the appearance 
                  of her being undressed And this Deponent further Saith that 
                  he entered into conversation with the person who exhibited the 
                  said female and made many enquiries respecting her and the Exhibitor 
                  informed this Deponent that she was a female of the Hottentot 
                  Tribe and that he had brought her from the Cape of Good Hope 
                  having obtained her from the Dutch Boors who came from the interior 
                  down to the Cape and that he had made an agreement with the 
                  Government at the Cape and they had given him permission to 
                  take her to this Country And this Deponent saith that upon the 
                  Exhibitor informing him that he brought her to England with 
                  the consent of the Government at the Cape he was much surprized 
                  and said what did Lord Calledon who is Governor at the Cape 
                  give permission for her being brought to England and the exhibitor 
                  answered that he did and upon being interrogated if Lord Calledons 
                  permission was in writing the exhibitor said it was and upon 
                  being further asked if Lord Calledon knew that she was brought 
                  to this Country to be exhibited he answered Oh! Yes, Yes, upon 
                  which this Deponent Being in the habit of corresponding with 
                  him and doubting the truth of these assertions stated to the 
                  Exhibitor that he wished to see the permission which Lord Calledon 
                  had signed for her - being brought to England as he know his 
                  hand writing upon which the Exhibitor said what wont you believe 
                  my word, I have already told you that he has signed it and I 
                  shall give you no further satisfaction a conversation to this 
                  effect passed between the Exhibitor and this Deponent at the 
                  time aforesaid And this Deponent saith that he proceeded to 
                  ask further questions of the said Exhibitor relative to the 
                  said female but the Exhibitor excused himself from giving any 
                  more information respecting her by saying I do not choose to 
                  have so many questions put to me or words to that effect And 
                  this Deponent Saith that during the time he remained in the 
                  room he paid particular attention to the Conduct and behaviour 
                  of the said Exhibitor and also of the said female and he says 
                  that the said Exhibitor sometimes would call the said female 
                  to him, and when she came would desire her to turn round and 
                  would invite the spectators to feel her posterior parts and 
                  at other times if she was at a distance from him would desire 
                  her to turn round in order that every body might see her extraordinary 
                  shape if in the Recess he would call her out for exhibition 
                  and in fact she is exhibited to the public in the same manner 
                  that any animal of the brute creation would be exhibited And 
                  the Deponent saith from the unhappy and dejected countenance 
                  of the said female and from the expressive look of disapprobation 
                  which she gives when ordered to exhibit herself and from her 
                  frequent sighs he considers the said female is unhappy in her 
                  situation and that she is under the restraint and controul of 
                  her exhibitor and is deprived of her liberty And this Deponent 
                  further saith that during the time he was in the room, the Exhibitor 
                  gave to the said female a musical Instrument somewhat like a 
                  guitar and desired her to play upon it and upon that occasion 
                  he particularly observed that the said female by her looks gave 
                  evident signs of mortification and misery at her degraded situation 
                  in being made a spectacle for the derision of the by standers 
                  without the power of resistance And this Deponent further saith 
                  that the said African Institution are willing to take the said 
                  female under their care and protection and to bear all expenses 
                  of restoring her to her Country and friends if they are permitted 
                  to do so And these Deponents Peter Van Wageninge and Thomas 
                  Gisborne Babington severally say that at the request of the 
                  said Zachary Macaulay they went on the fifteenth day of October 
                  now instant to see the said female in Piccadilly aforesaid and 
                  having paid two shillings each they were admitted into the said 
                  room and found her exhibited upon a stage as described by the 
                  last Deponent And this Deponent Peter Van Wageninge saith that 
                  he is a native of Holland and being informed by the Exhibitor 
                  that the said female could speak the Dutch language although 
                  not perfectly well, he this Deponent put many question to the 
                  said female and amongst others he enquired of her whence she 
                  came whether she had any relations whether she was happy and 
                  comfortable here and whether she was desirous of returning home, 
                  all which questions were asked in the language in which the 
                  exhibitor spoke to the said female but the said female would 
                  not answer any of such questions And both these Deponents Peter 
                  Van Wageninge and Thomas Gisborne Babington say they remained 
                  in the room with the said female with many other spectators, 
                  for nearly an hour and during that time she never spoke but 
                  the Exhibitor frequently desired her either to come out of the 
                  little recess into which she occasionally walks from off the 
                  said stage and to come to him or if she was upon the stage to 
                  turn herself round for public exhibition and when he gave these 
                  commands it was in the Dutch Language and he gave them in the 
                  same manner as he would to any of the brute creation - If she 
                  was in the little recess his order was &quot;come out&quot;, 
                  if upon the stage &quot;come here&quot; or &quot;turn round&quot; 
                  just as he might wish and the said female obeyed the orders 
                  in the same manner that animals of the brute creation obey similar 
                  commands - that whilst these Deponents were present they heard 
                  the said female utter several deep sighs evidently as from a 
                  being whose mind is distressed and which her countenance strongly 
                  shows her to be And these Deponents Peter Van Wageninge and 
                  Thomas Gisborne Babington say that the said female is called 
                  by the exhibitor toward the persons standing round the stage 
                  and they are invited to feel her posterior parts to satisfy 
                  themselves that no act is practiced And these Deponents Peter 
                  Van Wageninge and Thomas Gisborne Babington do verily believe 
                  from the dejected appearance of the said female and from the 
                  obedience which she pays to the commands of her exhibitor that 
                  she is compleatly under restraint and control and is deprived 
                  of her liberty And these Deponents further severally say that 
                  during the time they were present the said female at one time 
                  appeared very morose and sullen and retired into the little 
                  recess off the stage and appered unwilling to come out again 
                  when called by the Exhibitor and the Exhibitor felt it necessary 
                  on that occasion to let down a curtain which when drawn separates 
                  the stage and little recess from the other part of the room 
                  And this Deponent Thomas Gisborne Babington saith that the Exhibitor 
                  after the curtain was let down looked behind it and held up 
                  and shook his hand at her but without speaking and he soon afterward 
                  drew up the Curtain and again called her out to public view 
                  and she came forward again upon the stage And these Deponents 
                  severally say they are informed and believe that the said females' 
                  name is Saartgee and that the name of the person who has the 
                  possession of her is Henrick Cesar </td>
