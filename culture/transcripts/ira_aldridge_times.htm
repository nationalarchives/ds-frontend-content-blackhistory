                <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An experiment, and not a remarkably 
                  successful one, as the emptiness of the house incontestably 
                  proved; was last night essayed here. The tragedy of <em>Othello</em> 
                  was performed, the part of the Moor by an individual, of Negro 
                  origin, as his features sufficiently testify, who calls himself 
                  Aldridge, and who has been facetiously nick-named &quot;the 
                  African Roscius.&quot; Such an exhibition is well enough at 
                  Sadler's Wells, or at Bartholomew fair, but it certainly is 
                  not very creditable to a great national establishment. We could 
                  not perceive any fitness which Mr. Aldridge possessed for the 
                  assumption of one of the finest parts that was ever imagined 
                  by Shakspeare, except, indeed, that he could play it in his 
                  own native hue, without the aid of lampblack or pomatum, just 
                  as Stephen Kemble was, by nature, enabled to personate Falstaff 
                  without the ordinary stuffing; but Mr. Kemble's Falstaff, notwithstanding 
                  his ready-made obesity, was miserably deficient in humour; and 
                  Mr. Aldridge's Othello, with all the advantage of &quot;<em>hic 
                  niger est,</em>&quot; wanted spirit and feeling. His accent 
                  is unpleasantly, and we would say, vulgarly foreign; his manner, 
                  generally, drawling and unimpressive; and when, by chance (for 
                  chance it is, and not judgment), he rises to a higher strain, 
                  we perceive in the transition the elevation of rant, not the 
                  fiery dignity of soul-felt passion. His performance in the third 
                  act - that overpowering act - was weak. The &quot;<em>vale!</em>&quot; 
                  which is music in itself when delivered by an actor of even 
                  ordinary voice and judgment, was miserably feeble. A few plaudits 
                  followed it, but &quot;the judicious grieved.&quot; Much praise 
                  has been given to Shakspeare for the arguments which Iago adduces 
                  to prove that nothing but a light, fickle constitution - a hankering 
                  after novelty - could ever have induced so fair and gentle a 
                  creature as Desdemona to view the Moor with the feelings of 
                  love. The performance of last night was a keenly illustrative 
                  comment upon that point. Well might Desdemona's father imagine 
                  that sorcery, and not nature, had caused his daughter to listen 
                  to such a wooer. It is, however, our duty to state that Mr. 
                  Aldridge was extremely well received. He &quot;fit audience 
                  found, though few.&quot; Mr Warde's Iago evinced far more than 
                  an average portion of merit, but, like almost all whom we have 
                  seen in the character, he allowed the villainy of Iago to appear 
                  too much on the surface. Iago should</td>

                  We were greatly pleased with Miss E. Tree's Desdemona. In the 
                  early scenes her manner, playful, delicate, confiding, was quite 
                  in unison with the feelings of one to whom the annoyances of 
                  life were as yet unknown; but the picture changes; and the harrowing 
                  grief which the altered temper of the Moor creates was described 
                  by Miss E. Tree with painful fidelity. Her acting was very beautiful 
                  in the scene where, in contradiction to the Moor's most rudely-couched 
                  accusation, she asseverates her innocence.</td>
